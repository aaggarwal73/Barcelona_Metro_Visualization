            "#text": "<h3>Ciutadella, ground zero</h3>
<p>Ciutadella is one of the parks most admired by the locals. It occupies the land where the fortress and esplanade were built on the orders of Philip V following his victory over the Catalans in the War of Succession. Nearly <strong>one thousand houses</strong> were demolished here and in their place an imposing pentagonal construction was built, from where it was possible to control the whole city: it was the biggest <strong>military fortress</strong> in Europe.</p>
<p>Today, the repressive symbol that Ciutadella represented has long gone, and in the park Barcelona residents of all ages mix with tourists from around the world. There are places to relax, walk, run, cycle, admire the many works of art that adorn it and appreciate the abundant vegetation, including trees planted in the 19th century.</p>
<h3>A place to enjoy and see history</h3>
<p>The park&#8217;s current look is down to Josep Fontserè, who won the urban development competition in 1871 with his plans for a large, landscaped area with flowerbeds, trees and an artificial lake. In the years that followed, the park gradually took shape until the Universal Exposition of 1888 gave it a final boost. That was when the <strong>Cascade Fountain</strong>, greenhouse, bandstand and Castle of Three Dragons were built. Shortly after, a zoo was planned, which opened in 1892.</p>
<p>All that remains of Philip V&#8217;s fortress are a chapel, the Governor&#8217;s Palace, (currently a school) and the arsenal, the seat of the <strong>Parliament of Catalonia </strong>since 1979.</p>
<p>Other features were added at the start of the 20th century, such as the pond in front of the Parliament and the rather unusual <strong>stone </strong>mammoth. The equestrian statue of General Prim is also worthy of note, as is the figure crying in the centre of the pond: a copy of Josep Llimona&#8217;s masterpiece <strong><em>Desconsol</em></strong>, or <strong><em>Despair</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The former <strong>bullring</strong> in Plaça Espanya, Les Arenes, is today one of the most important and popular shopping centres in the city, both for the locals and tourists. Its history as a bullring dates back to 1900, when it was built by <strong>the architect August Font i Carreres</strong> in <strong>traditional Neo-Mudejar</strong> style, making it one of the most important bullrings in Spain.</p>
<p>Apart from bullfighting, the ring has witnessed <strong>a number of difficult circumstances</strong> in the course of Barcelona&#8217;s history, being converted into barracks for the republican side during the <strong>Civil War</strong>. It later became the setting for boxing, circus and festivals. In the 1940s and 50s it was equipped with a <strong>detachable velodrome</strong> to enable cycling events to be held, at a time when <strong>competitive sports</strong> started to become fashionable in Catalan society.</p>
<h3>Privileged views</h3>
<p>The last bullfight was held in 1977 with the bullfighter José Manuel Dominguín, among others. The ring then fell into disuse until<strong> 2007</strong> when the decision was made to convert it into a shopping centre. Curiously, the architects Richard Rogers and Alfonso Balaguer decided to maintain<strong>the old facade</strong> and add a roof in the shape of a dome, from where <strong>the best views of Barcelona can be seen</strong>.</p>
<p> The shopping centre has shops, cinemas, and all kinds of services which, combined with the beauty that has been preserved, have made it very popular.</p>

One of the most outstanding features here is the <strong>Joan Antoni Samaranch Collection</strong>, which takes the visitor on a journey through the <strong>Olympic world </strong>through exhibits relating to various artistic disciplines.</p>
<h3>An innovative, technological museum</h3>

<p>Parc del Fòrum is the legacy of an unprecedented event held in Barcelona in 2004, namely, the <strong>Universal Forum of Cultures</strong>. Then the site brought together people from all over the world and contributed to the dialogue on <strong>cultural diversity</strong>, sustainable development and the conditions for peace.</p>
<p>Walking through the park now you can still feel the essence of those dialogues that began ten years ago. <strong>Parc dels Auditoris</strong>, one of the areas that has been reclaimed, is a large, open-air space by the sea, with a spectacular photovoltaic panel suspended in a forest of very peculiar columns that has become a real symbol of the commitment to <strong>sustainability and the environment</strong>.</p>
<p>Various acts and <strong>big events</strong> are held throughout the park during the year that have had an international echo, and the fact that it can hold 65,000 people at any one time has turned it into a meeting point for people from all over the world.</p>
<h3><strong>A versatile space</strong></h3>
<p>In reality it is not a green space or urban park in the usual sense, rather it is a <strong>big area</strong> that combines a number of spaces and facilities where all kinds of <strong>acts and events</strong> are held today.</p>
<p>The park&#8217;s central stage is a reclaimed area in front of the sea, with an <strong>esplanade</strong> that holds <strong>fairs </strong>like the Catalan version of Seville&#8217;s April Fair, <strong>music festivals</strong> such as Primavera Sound and large-scale events of other kinds.</p>
<p>Inside the park you will also find the Fòrum Building, which houses the <strong>Museu Blau</strong> and the <strong>CCIB</strong>, <strong>the Barcelona International Conference Centre</strong>, which holds a large number of big conferences in the course of the year. Regarded as being <strong>unique in Europe</strong>, for its beauty and original architecture, and with a capacity of 15,000 people, it is a very versatile, multipurpose meeting centre with spectacular views of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The Castell de Montjuïc, or Montjuïc Castle, is on the <strong>highest part of the hill</strong>, facing the sea and dominating the whole city. It is a 17th-century fortress built by the military engineer Juan Martín Cermeño, which has lived through numerous <strong>important historical episodes</strong> and been a key witness to various periods.</p>
<h3>A place with historical memory</h3>
<p>A witness of critical moments, it functioned as a <strong>prison</strong> for anarchists during the 19th century and in 1940, after the Spanish Civil War, the president of the Generalitat, <strong>Lluís Companys</strong>, was shot there along with lots of other political prisoners of the Franco regime.</p>
<p>Today it can be visited as a place of historical interest and, if you make your way up to the highest point of Montjuïc, you will be rewarded by one of the most impressive views of Barcelona&#8217;s port and harbour you can get.</p>

<p>It is one of the most important musical institutions in Barcelona and Catalonia, as it aims to offer its own musical project for everyone. It is home to the <strong>Orquestra</strong> <strong>Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya</strong>, the <strong>Banda Municipal de Barcelona</strong>, and also to the <strong>Museu de la Música</strong>.</p>
<h3>A musical universe</h3>
<p>Designed by the architect Rafael Moneo and opened in 1999, the Auditori building encompasses <strong>three halls</strong>: Pau Casals, Oriol Martorell and Tete Montoliu, all with different capacities and all studied acoustically by the specialist engineer Higini Arau. Within its <strong>plain modernity </strong>, one of the distinctive features of the building is the central entrance foyer, where a <strong>monumental cubic glass lantern</strong> has been constructed in an impluvium shape, decorated with striped paintings by Pablo Palazuelo.</p>
<p>An important function of the Auditori is education, so it also houses a music school, the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Superior de Música de Catalunya</strong>,along with a musical education programme addressed to families and children, for them to learn and enjoy the musical <strong>art</strong>.</p>

<p>The origins of the&nbsp;Teatre Nacional de Catalunya ;are linked to the <strong>theatre tradition</strong> of the country, which has always been highly <strong>rich and creative</strong>, as well as daring, and this continues today. In the 1980s, Catalan society sensed that it needed a place where actors and directors could work freely. The creation of the TNC is also closely associated with the outstanding actor <strong>Josep Maria Flotats</strong> who, after returning from France in the 1980s following the end of the Franco dictatorship, took on a prominent role in institutionalising Catalan theatre and he became the first director of the new Teatre Nacional de Catalunya.</p>
<h3>Interdisciplinary stage</h3>
<p>Since it was created in 1996, the TNC has experienced many phases with various proposals, but it has always been committed to <strong>maximum quality</strong> and providing an area to promote other disciplines, such as dance, opera and puppetry. Today it is directed by <strong>Xavier Albertí</strong> with a varied, national and international programme. Apart from enjoying one of the performances staged, it is also worth making a visit for the architectural value of its avant-garde building, designed by the architect <strong>Ricard Bofill</strong>.</p>

<p>CosmoCaixa, Barcelona&#8217;s science museum, is housed in a <strong>Modernista building</strong> dating from 1909 that was designed by the architect Josep Domènech i Estapà. Initially it was a home for the blind, the Empar de Santa Llúcia, which closed in 1979. Two years later the <strong>first popular science museum</strong> in the whole of Spain and one of the best in Europe, opened there. This was an innovative idea for taking science to the public.</p>
<p>Following a <strong>refurbishment</strong> in 2004 that expanded the museum&#8217;s facilities to the current 50,000 square metres, it was renamed CosmoCaixa and is known by that name today.</p>
<h3>A place to enjoy</h3>
<p>Museum highlights include the <strong>Planetarium</strong>, which offers an extraordinary space voyage, travelling though time to the stars and planets; the <strong>Geological Wall</strong>, consisting of seven large cuts of real rock for geological interpretation; the <strong>Matter Room</strong>, where you can become a scientist and set the limits to physics; and the <strong>Flooded Forest</strong>, which recreates an Amazonian ecosystem including animal and plant species from that part of the world. To create this exhibition, scientists travelled to the Brazilian state of Pará to make exact moulds and faithful reproductions of the large trees and plants that grow there.</p>
<p>CosmoCaixa represents a real <strong>challenge to the senses</strong> and it is one of the best leisure options in the city, designed for young and old alike. Housed in a landmark building, it has put Modernisme at the service of the most modern science.</p>

<p>The Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium is one of the most iconic&nbsp;sports facilities in <strong>Montjuïc</strong> <strong>Park</strong>, forming part of the so-called <strong>Olympic Ring</strong>.It hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the <strong>1992</strong> <strong>Olympic Games in Barcelona</strong>along with many other important events over the course of its history,which is why it holds a special place in the hearts of many citizens.</p>
<p> Built by the architect Lluís Abellán Aynés and opened in 1929 as part of the <strong>Barcelona International Exposition</strong>,at that time is played host to five of the most important matches of La Liga, and was up and running until 1955, when the <strong>Mediterranean Games </strong>were held.Following these Games, the stadium experienced a period of decline and it was not until 1992, with the Barcelona Olympics, that the team of architects comprised of Vittorio Gregotti, Frederic Correa, Alfons Milà, Joan Margarit and Carles&amp; Buxadé completely remodelled the stadium. Leaving the exterior facade intact, new stands were built inside the stadium, giving it a total capacity of <strong>54,000 spectators.</strong></p>
<h3>Top level sport</h3>
<p>It has been classified by UEFA as a <strong>five star stadium</strong>, which means it can host top level international sports competitions. In 2010 it hosted the <strong>European Athletic Championships, </strong>for which it was once again remodelled, and currently, both visitors and locals consider it to be, along with Camp Nou, one of the city&#8217;s key sports facilities. It was named after the president of the Generalitat during the Civil War, <strong>Lluís Companys</strong>,who was executed by firing squad at Montjuïc Castle,close to the site of the stadium.</p>

<p>Out of all the waterfalls and fountains that Carles Buïgas designed to embellish the <strong>entrance to Montjuïc</strong>, the Magic Fountain is regarded as the most beautiful and one of Barcelona&#8217;s must-visit <strong>sights</strong>. Its history dates back to the International Exposition in 1929, when the organisers felt it was necessary to design a special feature that was bold and would surprise people. That was how the civil engineer <strong>Carles Buïgas</strong> came up with the idea of the Magic Fountain and, although many initially thought it was too ambitious, it was eventually built in under a year with light shows very similar to those you can see today.</p>
<h3>A must</h3>
<p>Buïgas enchanted the public with <strong>light shows</strong> that made the fountain more attractive and turned it into a &#8220;magic fountain&#8221;. The fantastic show offered by <strong>moving water</strong>, <strong>coloured lights</strong> and the <strong>music</strong> that was added in the 1980s, means the fountain is a must for anyone who wants to know Barcelona.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A dream building</h3>
<p>The creation of this museum was a long-held dream that finally came true. In 1953, writer and art critic <strong>Alexandre Cirici</strong> created the Associació d’Artistes Actuals (Association of Contemporary Artists) with the aim of bringing <strong>contemporary art </strong>together in a single space, as had already been done at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the famous MOMA. However, it was not until 1987 that this idea became a reality when architect <strong>Richard Meier</strong> was commissioned to build a unique building in which to house it.</p>
<p>The MACBA is located in the Raval neighbourhood, in <strong>Plaça dels Àngels</strong>, a bright, light space measuring some 14,000 square metres, which was the first step in the process of redeveloping the area. Meier&#8217;s <strong>modern and rationalist </strong>architecture, with a very light building, made from glass, metal and reflective elements, contrasts with the placidness and Gothic sobriety of the <strong>Convent dels Àngels</strong>, one of the buildings integrated into the MACBA which hosts exhibitions, and the Alexandre Cirici Document Centre, with a collection of more than 64,000 documents.</p>
<h3>Contemporary art</h3>
<p>The MACBA collection, which includes <strong>5,500 works </strong>by different artists, offers a journey through art from the abstract art of the mid 20th century, through European pop art and the new avant-garde, up to the present day. The collection includes works by distinguished <strong>local artists</strong>, such as Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, Joan Brossa, Joan Ponç, the Dau al Set collective, Josep Maria Subirachs, Jaume Plensa and the Mallorcan artist Miquel Barceló. It also has work by <strong>national and international artists</strong>, particularly South Americans and artists from Eastern countries, including works from distinguished artists such as the Equipo Crónica collective, Jorge Oteiza, Alexander Calder, Andy Warhol, Gordon Matta-Clark and Jean-Michel Basquiat, among many others.</p>
<p>The MACBA forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, which aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage. Alongside this initiative, the MACBA celebrated the 25th anniversary of the mural produced by <strong>Keith Haring</strong> in 1989, as part of the fight against AIDS, by restoring it.</p>

<p>The Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC) in <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong> greets you from the imposing <strong>Palau Nacional</strong>, the work of Eugenio Cendoya and Enric Catà built for the <strong>International Exposition in 1929</strong>.</p>
<p>The national art museum holds the best <strong>collection of Romanesque murals</strong> in the world, lots of them rescued from small rural churches in the <strong>Pyrenees</strong> and transported to Barcelona to protect Catalonia&#8217;s heritage. These original, post 11th-century paintings, such as those of Sant Quirze de Pedret and Santa Maria d’Àneu, are of unique value.</p>
<p>One of the masterpieces in the collection consists of the paintings from the Sant Climent de Taüll apse, with the famous <strong><em>Pantocrator</em> </strong>or <em>Christ in Majesty</em>, unquestionably the masterpiece of the 12th century and tangible proof of the creative power of Catalan painting.</p>
<h3>A big art gallery</h3>
<p>The museum houses works by the best representatives of <strong>Catalan Modernisme</strong> too, such as Gaudí and Casas. It also has a collection of <strong>Gothic art</strong> and another of work by European Renaissance painters, for example, Titian and Velázquez. Interest in its <strong>contemporary art collection</strong> focuses on the works of Solana, Dalí and Alfred Sisley,</p>
<p>The museum&#8217;s origins date back to 1934, when it opened with a medieval collection. Gradually it turned into the big museum we know today, adding the famous Romanesque art exhibition hall and, finally, in 2004, the modern art collection.</p>
<p>Surrounded by nature and in a privileged location, the variety of its collections over time can give us the pleasure of learning through art.</p>

<p>In the bustling Carrer Aragó, the Foundation is located in a <strong>Modernista building</strong> created at the end of the 19th century by the architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which was previously the head offices of the famous <strong>publishing house</strong> <strong> Montaner i Simon</strong>.Created at the peak of Catalan Modernisme, this was the first house in the city to integrate industrial typology, combining brickwork and wrought iron. Today, it is recognisable from a distance because of the <strong>iron </strong><strong>sculpture </strong> with which Tàpies crowned the facade, entitled <em>Núvol i cadira (Cloud and chair)</em>. It hovers over the building as an aesthetic thought and invites you to penetrate the artist&#8217;s universe.</p>
<h3>Much more than a museum</h3>
<p>Apart from the vast collection of work by Tàpies from the 1940s until today , the Fundació Antoni Tàpies organises <strong>temporary exhibitions </strong> by a range of contemporary artists, along with talks, conferences, and film sessions, producing various publications to accompany these activities.The <strong>Foundation&#8217;s library</strong>,specialises in modern and contemporary art, and has the most valuable collection of information on art in the city.</p>
<p> It is important to highlight the exhibition in the basement of the artist&#8217;s private collection, composed of various works of art of all kinds and origins, such as paintings by Francisco de Goya, Zurbarán, Picasso, Joan Miró,Marcel Duchamp, Georges Braque, etc.,along with various pieces of Asian, African and Pre-Columbian art, medieval works, pieces of archaeology and books from various places.For all these reasons, the Fundació Antoni Tàpies is one of the most important museums in Barcelona and one of the gems of artistic culture and life in the city.</p>

<p>The Casa de la Caritat, or House of Charity, was established in the <strong>early 19th century </strong>as a place for accommodating the city&#8217;s beggars and forsaken people. It was a means of reducing poverty in the area but, over time, this building, built during the splendour of Modernisme, has come to serve a very different purpose. The Casa de la Caritat is now a cultural complex which, situated in the Raval neighbourhood, has filled the area with <em>art and culture</em>. The Barcelona Contemporary Culture Centre, or CCCB, is housed in the main building and it is here that the most modern aspects of the city&#8217;s culture can be seen: exhibitions, concerts, debates and festivals, always with a focus on new technologies and new languages. An ever emerging space of <strong>creators and artists </strong>which has a theatre and a laboratory centre for new creations and which forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>
<h3>An open space</h3>
<p>The project to convert the Casa de la Caritat into the <strong>CCCB </strong>won the FAD Design Award in 1993. A welcoming prismatic structure and a glass facade, which appears to be leaning over the <strong>Pati de les Dones</strong>, have become one of the city&#8217;s key landmarks. The mirrors and their reflections are a metaphor for the way the city&#8217;s landscape is constantly changing, without losing its essence.</p>
<p>In the centre there is a square, <strong>Plaça de les Dones</strong>, around which there is the Ramon Llull University and spaces belonging to the Museum of Contemporary Art which complete the centre&#8217;s cultural offering.</p>
<p>The <strong>Pati Manning</strong>, the former cloister of the Casa de la Caritat seminary, is worthy of a special visit. It is a <strong>17th century cloister</strong>, nestled between the avant-garde and the new artistic languages. A cloister that, with its semicircular arches and sgraffito on the walls, speaks of a history which is very much alive in a building that has managed to transform itself into an important cultural focal point. A good time to visit it is during the <strong>La Mercè</strong> festival, which is when the traditional giants from all the surrounding neighbourhoods are installed here.</p>

Considered to be a masterpiece of modern architecture and engineering, the building was built in 1990 by Japanese architect Arata sozaki. It served as one of the main pavilions for the Olympic Games, hosting the artistic gymnastics competition and volleyball. It was also the main venue for the <strong>Paralympic Games </strong>that year.</p>
<h3>Big concerts</h3>
<p>Sant Jordi is also well known for hosting the biggest concerts held in the city.It has played host to performances by artists such as Madonna, Frank Sinatra and Beyoncé, and local residents tend to associate this venue with <strong>large scale music events</strong>. Its privileged setting, among the green vegetation of Montjuïc, and all the history it holds within, have made it the star sports facility of the Olympic Ring and a place that is visited daily by tourists, travellers and locals alike.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A century of study and outreach</h3>
<p>The Fabra Observatory is one of the oldest still-active observatories in the world. Its long history has permitted systematic and continuous study of the local <strong>climate</strong>, <strong>seismic activity </strong>in the area, and <strong>astronomy</strong>. It was formally inaugurated in 1904 in the presence of King Alfonso XIII, and belongs to the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Barcelona. Its name comes from Camil Fabra i Fontanills, Marquis of Alella, an industrialist and politician from Barcelona who donated a large sum of money for a project that was initially only to cover two areas: astronomy and meteorology.</p>
<p>The Observatory has received several awards including the Narcís Monturiol Plaque conferred by the Generalitat (regional government) of Catalonia, and the Gold Medal of the City of Barcelona granted by the City Council</p>
<p>In 2014 the European Physical Society (EPS) designated the Fabra Observatory as an EPS Historic Site. This honour recognises the Observatory’s discovery of an atmosphere on Titan&nbsp;(in addition to a number of other discoveries), and its centenary series of (meteorological and seismic) observations. The Fabra Observatory is the first centre in Spain to receive this distinction from the EPS.</p>
<h3>Under the stars</h3>
<p>The tours organised by the Fabra Observatory are an unforgettable experience, as they include direct observations of the <strong>Moon, Jupiter, Saturn </strong>or<strong> Mars</strong>, according to the time of year, as well as various other heavenly bodies, and even the possibility of dinner under the stars. The observations are made just as they were a century ago, namely with the giant <strong>refracting telescope </strong>that dates from 1904.</p>
<p>When entering or leaving the observatory, visitors make another wonderful discovery: a short <strong>botanical route </strong>around the gardens that surround it, where you can see pines, firs, cypresses, holm oaks and box trees, mimosa, laurels and mastic, as well as many other species.</p>

<p>Mercat de les Flors is one of the <strong>facilities </strong>that make up Ciutat del Teatre, a theatre city with Plaça de Margarita Xirgu at the heart of the <strong>three theatre venues</strong>: Mercat de les Flors, Teatre Lliure and the Institut del Teatre.</p>

            "#text": "<h3 class=\"title\">A dreamlike landscape</h3>
<p>As soon as you walk through the main gate, flanked by two buildings that look as if they have been lifted straight out of a fairy tale, you enter a <strong>different world</strong>, an original, enchanting universe where <strong>architecture and gardens</strong> merge to create a dreamlike landscape. The <strong>dragon, covered in ceramic mosaic</strong>, keeps an eye on the visitors who are on the look out for every last detail: snails, mushrooms, flowers, and leaves. Every nook and cranny of the park leads to a discovery.</p>
<p>At the start of the 20th century, <strong>Eusebi Güell</strong>, a leading figure in the city, wanted to create a place where the wealthy could have a home, a <strong>city garden</strong> in the English style, which explains why it is called Park Güell. Paths, staircases, a square, a service pavilion and even a <strong>demonstration home</strong> were all built but the project flopped. So, in 1922, six years after Eusebi Güell died, Barcelona City Council bought the land and turned the site into a <strong>public park</strong>, the most unusual in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>&#8216;s boundless imagination is present in every corner of the park, which holds surprising features for the visitors who come from all over the world. The ceramic dragon at the entrance gives way to a <strong>hypostyle hall</strong>, an open space with 86 Doric columns that was supposed to have held the garden-city market. The square above it, which grows out of the mountain and symbolises the <strong>union of nature and architecture</strong>, is bordered by an <strong>undulating bench </strong>covered by a ceramic mosaic, which was designed by a disciple of Gaudí, Josep Maria Juju. The bench, softened by its wavy features, offers one of the best <strong>views of the city</strong>.</p>
<p>It is not just the bench that snakes its way round, the <strong>paths</strong>, <strong>porticoes</strong> and <strong>viaducts</strong> do too. Avoiding straight lines, Gaudí imagined a style of architecture in harmony with plant life and nature, forming a symbiosis between stone and green.</p>
<p>Faced with the failure of the project and realising that not even one house would be sold, Gaudí himself lived in the demonstration home until 1926. Today it houses the <strong>Museu Gaudí</strong>, where you can see his drawings, as well as models and furniture he designed.</p>
<p>When Antoni Gaudí qualified as an architect, the university chancellor, Elies Rogent, said: &#8220;We have given this qualification to a genius or a madman, only time will tell&#8221;. Well, Time has given its verdict: since 1984, Park Güell, <strong>Gaudí&#8217;s work of genius</strong>, has been recognised as a <strong>World Heritage site by UNESCO</strong></p>

<p>At the crossroads between La Rambla, Passeig de Colom and the Port de Barcelona rises an iron column topped by Cristòfor Colom welcoming visitors. The monument in honour of the man who discovered America was inaugurated for the 1888 Universal Exposition, and marked the end of the work to redesign the Barcelona port and coastline. A 60 m high column and 233 tonnes of iron make up the pedestal for the <strong>7 m tall statue</strong></p>
<h3>Discover the views</h3>
<p>What is really impressive is the <strong>tower&#8217;s viewpoint</strong>, which you get to via an internal elevator. The <strong>360º panoramic views</strong> of the city allow you to see the Gothic Quarter to the north, with its historical buildings like the cathedral and Santa Maria del Mar, Les Rambles and even the domes of the Sagrada Família; looking to the south you can see Montjuïc mountain and the Olympic Ring; if you turn to the east, you can see the Fòrum and the towers at the entrance to the Port Olímpic, even Frank Gehry&#8217;s golden fish; and if you look to the west there is Collserola and the magical mountain of Tibidabo.</p>
<p>The square where the Mirador de Colom tower is located is called <strong>Portal de la Pau</strong>, and it is a memorial to the end of the Second World War, but the fame of the explorer&#8217;s statue is so great that the square has lost its real name: everyone knows it as Plaça Colom.</p>
<p>The statue of Columbus is one of the city&#8217;s icons. Trying to guess where the finger is pointing is a real challenge, and having your photo taken with the <strong>lions that flank the entrance gates</strong>, a tradition.</p>

<p>At the end of the 19th century, Robert Robert i Surís, the Marquis of Robert and a highly influential aristocrat of the time from Girona, commissioned the construction of his main residence in what was then one of the most privileged parts of Barcelona the corner of <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> and Avinguda Diagonal. Built between 1898 and 1903, Palau Robert was designed by <strong>the French architect Henri Grandpierre</strong> and built with <strong>stone from Montgrí</strong> by the Catalan architect Joan Martorell. It stands out for its <strong>Neoclassical architecture</strong>, not at all like the prevailing Modernisme, which was spreading throughout the Eixample.</p>
<p>The Palau Robert garden was designed by the <strong>municipal gardener Ramon Oliva</strong>,who would later be in charge of designing the Plaça Catalunya gardens.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>On the death of the marquis in 1929, the Robert family tried to sell the mansion. After the <strong>Civil War</strong> a company was set up to convert it into a hotel with an entertainment room but this never came off. Finally, in the 1980s, it became the property of the regional government, the <strong>Generalitat de Catalunya</strong>.</p>
<p>Having been used for various functions throughout its history, at the end of the 1990s it opened as the <strong>cultural centre</strong> we know today. The building also houses a <strong>tourist information centre.</strong> Its <strong>well-kept garden</strong> is open to the public and receives lots of visits from both tourists and locals.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>An explosion of creativity</h3>
<p>A second of silence is eternal. That which is produced by the public after hearing a perfect symphony or an aria in the pure voice of a soprano. A silence that is broken by thunderous applause. This is what you feel the first time you enter the Palau de la Música. Exuberant, voluptuous, impressive. We will never run out of adjectives to describe architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner&#8217;s magnificent building, the only concert hall to be declared <strong>World Heritage</strong> by UNESCO in 1997, a Modernista building on all four sides that reflects the will of Barcelona to modernise.</p>
<p>Its history began in 1905, when <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong>, one of the founders of Modernisme, was encharged with building a new concert hall for the <strong>Orfeó</strong> <strong>Català</strong>. With total creative freedom, he designed an allegory of nature in nymphs, flowers and plant motifs that made the perfect backdrop for listening to the music. The building was built around a glass-covered metallic structure, a very avant-garde idea for the times, and into it he integrated all the <strong>applied arts</strong>: sculpture, ironwork, stained glass and ceramics. Domènech i Montaner also wanted light to be an architectural element, so large panels of stained glass, other windows and a central skylight let the sun flood into the Palau. The <strong>Modernisme</strong> that is reflected by the Palau de la Música is more than an aesthetic trend: it represents an <strong>ideological movement</strong> that wanted to modernise the city.</p>
<h3>A privileged stage</h3>
<p>From its inauguration in 1908, the Palau de la Música, nestling right in the centre of the Ciutat Vella district, has been a privileged setting for music, but also for politics and ideas. Great musical masters like Enric Granados, Manuel de Falla, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky and Frederic Mompou made their debuts in this auditorium. The Palau de la Música is a benchmark not only in the worlds of music and Modernista architecture: is the symbol of an era in Barcelona, the age when it became a modern city.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>One of the best theatres in the world</h3>
<p>In the heart of the Rambla there is one of the <strong>oldest</strong>, most historical theatres in Barcelona: the Gran Teatre del Liceu. The quality of the opera and dance productions performed there, as well as the classical music concerts, make it one of the most <strong>renowned theatres in the world</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>mid 19th century</strong>, distinguished members of Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie decided there was a need to build a theatre befitting the importance the city was acquiring at a time of <strong>economic and cultural expansion</strong>, and this led to the construction of the Liceu in 1847, on the site previously occupied by the <strong>Convent dels Trinitaris Descalços</strong> on the Rambla. The first building was based on plans drawn up by architect Miquel Garriga i Roca with the help of Josep Oriol Mestres. The first serious fire to affect the building occurred in 1861, but it was restored and rose from the ashes as a great opera house. More than a century later, in 1994, the theatre succumbed to another <strong>serious fire</strong>. The building was faithfully reconstructed but the theatre was given a much more modern <strong>technical structure </strong>and was also extended.</p>
<h3><strong>Uniting tradition and modernity</strong></h3>
<p>As a symbol of <strong>culture and distinction </strong>in the city, the Liceu offers a programme that includes <strong>eternal classics </strong>such as Verdi, Mozart and Wagner alongside <strong>new and original concepts </strong>such as the contemporary jazz opera Porgy Bess by George Gershwin. The Liceu is also becoming increasingly committed to education in Catalonia and has established the <strong>Petit Liceu</strong>, a programme of music and arts designed to help young children develop their musical and creative sensibilities from a young age.</p>
<p>When we think of Barcelona, it is impossible not to think of the Rambla and the Liceu and, as a cultural symbol within the city, it is a <strong>benchmark </strong>that everyone should pay a visit to. The Liceu forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>Located on one of the sides of <strong>Montjuïc Park</strong>, not far from the Magic Fountain, is Poble Espanyol, an open-air architectural museum. It dates back to 1929, when architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch designed it as one of the attractions for the Barcelona International Exposition.</p>
<p>Designed to be a real town, with 117 buildings that represent the typical architectural features of different parts of the <strong>Iberian Peninsula</strong>, he reproduced <strong>true-scale </strong>versions of important streets, squares and buildings from across the peninsula. In this way, his design brings together <strong>typical constructions</strong> from the various regions of Spain, and visitors can stroll seamlessly from a Castilian square to an Andalusian street and enjoy the characteristic atmosphere of each place.</p>
<h3>A project with a long life</h3>
<p>Its harmonious, global features aim to represent what could be an ideal model town for the Iberian peninsula with all the diversity that entails. The project, which was supposed to run for six months, was such a huge success that in the end it stayed open and today attracts thousands of tourists and visitors every day who go there to discover one of the<br /> most iconic destinations on Montjuïc.</p>
<p>It is one of the top 10 most visited tourist destinations and, in addition to the architecture, it offers <strong>typical</strong> <strong>food </strong>and <strong>handicrafts</strong> from each of the places represented.</p>

<p>Located in the heart of <strong>Avinguda Diagonal, </strong>Casa de les Punxes is named after the six towers crowned with six spikes that give it a <strong>Gothic and medieval look</strong>.It was declared a <strong>National Historical Monument</strong> in 1976,and is one of the<strong> Modernista</strong> buildings in the Eixample that makes up the vast <strong>outdoor museum</strong> that can be observed by walking through what is one of the most emblematic parts of Barcelona. Created by the <strong>architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong> in 1905, Casa de les Punxes was commissioned by the Terrades sisters, an important bourgeois family of the early 20th century in Barcelona who wanted to join three properties they owned. The architect designed a <strong>medieval building</strong> with elements inspired in European Gothic architecture.</p>
<h3>Catalan decoration</h3>
<p>Apart from the magnificent towers, another feature to highlight is the highly decorated brickwork <strong>facade</strong> with decorative rosettes. In one of these, and typical of <strong>Modernista buildings</strong> of that time,there is the famous image of <strong>Sant Jordi</strong> with the legend in writing, which says: “Sant Patró de Catalunya Torneu-nos la llibertat” (Patron Saint of Catalonia. Give us back our freedom). Refurbished in 1980, Casa de les Punxes is still a private property, so it cannot be visited. Nevertheless, to observe its <strong>robust facade</strong> and the six spikes which crown it is an unforgettable visual experience.</p>

<p>The Born opened in 1876 as a <strong>municipal market</strong> and was one of the first buildings in Barcelona built with an <strong>exposed iron</strong> framework, following the European trend at the time. Little did anyone suspect then that underneath the new construction there lay hidden an <strong>archaeological site </strong>of great historical significance for the city.</p>
<p>Taking his inspiration from Les Halles in Paris, the architect Josep Fontserè designed a tall, open, functional space, which stood out for its metal structure, central dome and glazed-tile roof. In 1921 it became the central wholesale market, which operated until 1971 and was restored in 1977, although it was no longer in use.</p>
<h3>The lost city</h3>
<p class=\"Peromissi\">At the end of 2001, while work was being carried out on the site to house the Provincial Library, the <strong>remains of houses</strong> that had formed part of the Ribera neighbourhood came to light. Following that discovery, the alteration work was suspended and, four years later, the Catalan government declared it to be a <strong>Cultural Asset of National Interest</strong>.</p>
<p>Even though the site discovered at the Born represents less than 10% of <em>ground zero</em>, its excellent state of preservation has made it possible to recreate the life in<strong> Barcelona in 1700</strong>. Sixty dwellings have been identified, as well as streets, wells, sewers and other infrastructure. And the large number of items that have been recovered, including kitchen utensils, pieces of glass and porcelain, work tools, weapons and so on, mean it is now possible to faithfully reconstruct the everyday life of Barcelona&#8217;s populace in the 17th and early 18th centuries.</p>
<p>The Born Cultural Centre was opened in 2013 and, as well as the archaeological site, it is a venue for exhibitions, displays, talks, concerts, shows and other events.</p>
<p>Beyond its doors is one of most dynamic and picturesque neighbourhoods in Barcelona. People who have lived there all their lives rub shoulders with travellers passing through, hundred-year-old shops with restaurants offering contemporary cuisine, and medieval mansions with design studios. So the archaeological site shares the neighbourhood with the new trends that characterise it today.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The beginning of Modernisme and Art Nouveau</h3>
<p>As a starting point for the fruitful association between Eusebi Güell and the architect Antoni Gaudí, Palau Güell was the first important project that the artist carried out for the industrial tycoon. Built between 1886 and 1888, it is a wonderful example of Modernista architecture for residential use, with the combination of functionality and innovative design that Gaudí used to apply to his work.</p>
<p>The building is situated on Carrer <strong>Nou</strong><strong> de la Rambla</strong>, one of the most emblematic in the Raval neighbourhood. The choice of location is unusual, as a large proportion of the bourgeoisie were setting up home in the new Eixample. So the building stands out like a unique jewel and a rare bird among the smaller, more simple houses in the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Oriental and naturalist inspirations</h3>
<p>In the midst of his Orientalist period, Gaudí took his inspiration for this mansion from Islamic art, particularly Mudejar and Nazarite. This is the reason for the abundance of ceramic tiles, mitre arches and pinnacles in the shape of pavilions or domes. It is also considered to be one of the first <strong>Art</strong><strong> Nouveau</strong> buildings in the world, due to its stylised plant-like and organic shapes, inspired by nature. The building also plays masterfully with the concepts of light, space and volume. </p>
<p> It is worth noting too that it was the first time Gaudí used trencadís, the mosaic finish made from irregular pieces of broken tiles, that was later to become a hallmark of his work. Also, the mansion&#8217;s chimneys, each one different from the rest, serve to represent the ornamental concept that the architect would later apply to other projects such as La Pedrera and Casa Batlló. </p>
<p> Declared a Historical Artistic Monument by the Spanish government in 1969 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, Palau Güell is a building of great beauty that should be visited by anyone who wants to understand the work of Gaudí as a whole. It also forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>La Sagrada Família (Temple of the Holy Family) occupies an entire block between Carrer Mallorca and Carrer Provença, and it is one of the most visited sights in Barcelona. Building work started in 1883 and continues today, following the <strong>plans</strong> that <strong>Gaudí</strong>, aware he would not see the completion of the temple, left for his successors. The <strong>Modernista architect</strong> devoted 40 years of his life to it, the last 15 exclusively, and he is <strong>buried under the nave</strong>.</p>
<p>This architectural genius left the city one of the most original basilicas in the world. It is of great architectural interest and has been declared a <strong>World Heritage</strong> site. The symbolism of its <strong>three main facades</strong>, dedicated to the birth (the only one Gaudí was able to finish), the passion and resurrection of Christ, is so <strong>detailed</strong> and so <strong>profuse</strong> that just admiring this can take hours. Every year it astounds millions of visitors.</p>
<h3>The forest that reaches for the sky</h3>
<p>For the interior Gaudí took his inspiration <strong>from nature</strong> and designed enormous columns shaped like tree trunks that turn it into an exuberant <strong>stone forest</strong>. So far, eight towers have been built of the <strong>18</strong> he planned: 12 for the apostles, four for the evangelists, one for Mary and one for Jesus. Gaudí only managed one in his lifetime and even today no one knows how many years it will take before this enormous project is completed. In the meantime it will continue to be <strong>one of the most emblematic icons</strong> of Barcelona and Modernisme.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Gothic excellence</h3>
<p>In 1329, the <strong>mariners&#8217; guilds</strong> in La Ribera placed, on their own initiative, the first stone of what is considered the only entirely finished <strong>Catalan Gothic</strong> building: the church of Santa Maria del Mar. 55 years later, in 1383, and without the work being interrupted once, the doors of this great church opened. A temple which, through the years, and thanks to the success of Ildefonso Falcones&#8217;s novel, has come to be known as The Cathedral of the Sea.</p>
<p>Santa Maria del Mar is emblematic and unique, with <strong>three great naves</strong> of almost the same height, and columns every thirteen metres, a distance that was never exceeded in any medieval building.13 The whole building gives the <strong>sensation of being light </strong>and airy, spacious, and there is a notable lack of ornamentation. There are no ogival arches or filigree, and the flying buttresses are delicate. It is pure Catalan Gothic art. Only the light that filters through the stained glass windows adorns this basilica.</p>
<h3>Surprising and inspirational</h3>
<p>To go through the doors of Santa Maria del Mar is to find yourself amid the grandeur of the church, a <strong>marvel of construction</strong>. So much so, that according to reports, it was here that Antoni Gaudí was inspired to create the Sagrada Família.</p>
<p>Today, Santa Maria del Mar, nestling among the narrow streets of El Gòtic, surprises visitors as they turn the corner. The serenity that it transmits makes you think about the harbour porters, and the humility of the sea workers that managed to put up this cathedral in the middle of a sand pit.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The Gothic temple</h3>
<p>Barcelona Cathedral has been contemplating the city throughout eight centuries of history. In the 13th century <strong>King Jaume II, the Just</strong>, decided to construct a temple over the remains of an earlier Romanesque church. The work, funded by the fraternities and guilds, took more than 150 years, but never interrupted the religious services.</p>
<p>These days, the Catedral de Barcelona is one of the best examples of Gothic art in the city. Every day thousands of visitors take photos of the impressive 70 m high, <strong>Neo-Gothic façade</strong>. But the cathedral steps take you into a whole new world to be discovered. More than <strong>215 rib vault keystones</strong> in the interior give you and idea of the cathedral&#8217;s grandeur. Inside you also find the <strong>crypt of Santa Eulàlia</strong>, 29 dedicated chapels and a high altar above which there is an impressive Gothic stained glass window. For the most keen-eyed, the best test is to find the hockey game carved into the choir stalls.</p>
<h3>Secrets to discover</h3>
<p>But the cathedral also hides secrets you cannot appreciate at first glance. On the roofs and pinnacles there are <strong>200 gargoyles</strong> keeping watch from on high, but it is surprising to find a bull, a unicorn and an elephant among the monsters and demonic beings.</p>
<p>Before leaving the lofty reaches, the temple&#8217;s bells deserve a special mention. Of the <strong>21 bells</strong> in the cathedral, all with women&#8217;s names, the most remarkable is the rebellious <strong>Honorata</strong>. In 1714, during the War of Succession, Philip V &#8220;imprisoned&#8221; and melted down this bell in retaliation for it ringing to call the citizens to revolt.</p>
<p>The cathedral&#8217;s surprises go beyond its architecture. The garden, where you find the <strong>cloister</strong>, is guarded by the <strong>thirteen white geese</strong> of Santa Eulàlia, one for each of the agonies she suffered, as well as for the years of her life. There is also a fountain, where an egg dances on the flowing water at Corpus Christi, a typical Barcelona tradition.</p>
<p>The passage of time has only increased the majesty of the cathedral, guardian and guide to the city, and from its terraces it blesses the entire municipality of Barcelona at 9 am on 3 May each year for the feast of Santa Creu.</p>

<p>The Fundació Joan Miró in <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong> is one of Barcelona&#8217;s most prestigious artistic centres. It is housed in one of the most interesting buildings in the city, architecturally speaking. Designed by the architect <strong>Josep Lluís Sert</strong>, a close friend of Miró, it was conceived as an <strong>open space</strong> with indoor and outdoor terraces that allow visitors to circulate freely.</p>
<h3>The legacy of a painting genius</h3>
<p>The origins of the Miró Foundation date back to 1968, when the painter held his first <strong>big exhibition</strong> in Barcelona, which was at the old Hospital de la Santa Creu. After that, the cultural society of the time saw the need to create a space that could exhibit <strong>Miró&#8217;s work</strong> in the way it deserved. In line with the artist&#8217;s wishes, it was built as a space that would exhibit not only his work but also <strong>contemporary art</strong> in all its different facets.</p>
<p>The Miró Foundation was Barcelona&#8217;s first contemporary art museum. It marked a break and a turn to the avant-garde that it maintains today, as the depository of the works Miró gave to Barcelona and as a <strong>centre for popularising </strong>contemporary art.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The ideal setting</h3>
<p>Making use of the natural slope of a mountain to create an <strong>open-air stage </strong>with optimal acoustic conditions was a process used in classical Greek civilisation. And in Barcelona, you have the chance to enjoy a theatre with these very characteristics. The Grec, in <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong>, was opened as an outdoor theatre and one of the most spectacular places on the mountain. Although it might seem like it, it is not a relic left by the Ancient Greeks, but rather a construction that was painstakingly designed and built in 1929 for the Barcelona International Exposition. The architects who came up with the idea were Ramon&nbsp;Reventós&nbsp;and Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, who made use of an old disused quarry to create a theatre inspired by the&nbsp; Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus, in Peloponnese, in which the carved stone wall serves as a stage.</p>
<p>Major <strong>classical works </strong>have been performed here, although due to the Spanish Civil War it almost fell into disuse. In 1976, with the opening of the <strong>Grec</strong> Festival, it was given a new lease of life and since then, it sleeps in winter and awakens each summer to become the central venue of the city&#8217;s biggest performing arts festival. The Grec is the venue where the festival of the same name opens each year and it hosts all kinds of musical and theatrical shows.</p>
<h3>The theatre gardens</h3>
<p>Its <strong>stunning gardens </strong>are also worth a visit. Surrounding the theatre with trees, shrubs, plants and flowers, and formerly known as the Rosaleda d’Amargós Gardens, they were restored in 2008 by Patrizia Falcone, who gave them back their early 20th century appearance, when they were designed by the French architect <strong>Jean-Claude Forestier</strong>. At the entrance to the gardens, which are accessible from Passeig de Santa Madrona, there is a stone stairway that takes visitors up both sides of the wall. The geometry of the flower beds, the pergolas, the ponds, the creepers, bursting with colour, the orange trees and the multiple flowers on the rectangular terrace, create a dreamlike space which is a perfect place to take a break.</p>

It ends at the Magical Fountain and the Palau Nacional (which today houses the National Art Museum of Catalonia, MNAC), both of which were also built for the 1929 International Exhibition. The pavilions combine age-old tradition with <strong>state-of-the-art facilities </strong>and the infrastructure required for any event.

<p>A group of actors, directors and professionals opened the Teatre Lliure to the public on 2 December 1976, at premises in the <strong>Gràcia</strong> neighbourhood rented out to a consumer cooperative (La Lleialtat). Ever since they have seen theatre as a <strong>public service</strong>, with an attitude of ethical and aesthetic commitment linked to the present.</p>
<p>The Lliure opened a new, modern, well-equipped venue in 2001 on Montjuïc, in the old <strong>Palace of Agriculture</strong>. It has the Sala Fabià Puigserver, a multipurpose hall with seating for an audience of 720 and good technical fittings, and the Espai Lliure, for an audience of 172. The old venue in Gràcia has also been renovated, without losing its <strong>cosy, close</strong> feel that makes it so special for actors.</p>
<h3>The Kompanyia Lliure</h3>
<p>The 2013-2014 season saw the setting-up of <strong>La Kompanyia Lliure</strong>, with a core of actors who, because of their ages, correspond to what sociologists have called the &#8220;lost generation&#8221;, in other words, highly educated people who encounter numerous difficulties in finding work.</p>

<p>A visit to the museum is a journey through the history of this <strong>ancient civilisation</strong> and enables you to see some imposing works, including a statue of <strong>Ramesses III</strong>,<strong> mummies</strong> and hundreds of other <strong>items</strong>: jewellery, funeral steles, domestic utensils, portraits and so on. Thanks to the Clos Archaeological Foundation, the museum also publishes material and offers a master&#8217;s in Egyptology, as well as organising temporary exhibitions, children&#8217;s activities, research projects and even expeditions to Egypt.</p>
<h3>Fascination with Egypt</h3>
<p>The origin and history of the museum is closely linked to <strong>Jordi Clos Llombart</strong>, the chairman of a major hotel chain with a passion for Egypt. The starting point was an exhibition he organised in one of his hotels in 1992. It was so well received by the general public that he decided to establish the Egyptian Museum of Barcelona a couple of years later. Subsequently, the increase in the size of the collection and the number of visitors allowed it to move to its <strong>current home</strong> on Carrer de València, in 1992. Since then, the collection, the number of visitors and the museum itself have not stopped growing.</p>

<p>It is 144 m high and made of <strong>steel and glass</strong>. Circular, lacking interior columns and with <strong>colours as changeable</strong> as the Mediterranean. The Torre Agbar is the gateway to Sant Martí, which has been converted into Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>technology district.</strong></p>
<p>French architect Jean Nouvel worked with a studio of Catalan architects, <strong>b720</strong>, to design the tower, which is the third tallest building in the city.</p>
<p>He took his inspiration for the design from the rounded shapes of the peaks of <strong>Montserrat mountain</strong> and the pinnacles of the <strong>Sagrada Família</strong>. Two of the city&#8217;s main symbols merged in the architect&#8217;s mind to create a new one that has earned a place in the <strong>city&#8217;s iconography</strong> on its own merits.</p>
<h3>A sustainable tower</h3>
<p>The Torre Agbar is a <strong>smart building</strong> that meets all the requirements of energy efficiency, by having an exterior facade covered with photovoltaic panels and making use of groundwater. In 2011, the European Commission gave it the <strong>green building</strong> award.</p>

<p>Arts Santa Mònica was designed as a space for the <strong>most diverse in artistic disciplines </strong>to come together and interact:ranging from the visual and performing arts to music, audiovisual creation and design, not to mention other fields that are a far cry from the traditional concept of art and which can bring so much to creativity. This is what Arts Santa Mònica seeks to do: escape constraints, generate spaces for meeting and exchange and make room for the most daring and innovative in artistic expression<strong>.</strong> Hence its incorporation of work from such disciplines as literature, science, philosophy, architecture, fashion and cuisine. It is a fusion of all the elements that provide the <i>raison d&#8217;être </i>for Centre de la Creativitat which the Arts Santa Mònica has become. Arts Santa Mònica is part of the Raval Cultural project, a collection of over three hundred cultural offerings from the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Online projects</h3>
<p>Arts Santa Mònica also offers certain projects that you can consult online, such as the <strong>Arxiu Dossiers</strong>, that brings together the work of various artists working in Catalonia and which aims to raise awareness of contemporary Catalan art and the <strong>Science Blog</strong>, a space aimed at building bridges between scientific and humanistic knowledge.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>120 years of history</h3>
<p>Barcelona Zoo has always been very popular throughout its <strong>120 years</strong>. As an aside, it is worth mentioning that admission was free in the early days, although animal auctions and egg sales were organised to fund its maintenance.</p>
<p>Back then the zoo had lots of exotic animals, such as dromedaries, ostriches and an elephant. The latter, a female called Júlia, became the real star because, at that time, elephants were almost unknown to the people of the city.</p>
<p>The misery and hunger of the Civil War and post-war years meant many animals died, including the famous Júlia, and that in turn led to the zoo&#8217;s decline. Despite that, the economic recovery of subsequent decades led to an increase in the number of species and the facilities were improved. Since then, Barcelona Zoo has grown in every sense and become a <strong>European benchmark</strong>.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the zoo has gone from being a place for exhibiting animals to a <strong>research, study and education centre</strong>. Today it has modern facilities and looks after the welfare of the animals, which now number more than 2,000. Among the many facilities some stand out, like the primate gallery, the Komodo dragon facility, the palm grove with its aviaries and the dolphin pavilion.</p>
<h3>In memory of Snowflake</h3>
<p>Barcelona Zoo was home to an <strong>albino </strong>gorilla, the only one ever found in the world, which lived from 1966 to 2003. <strong>Snowflake</strong> was the undisputed star of the zoo, and his death was grieved by everyone in Barcelona. Although he has many descendants, no other white gorilla has been born, which has led to a call for one to be cloned. This is scientifically possible as the zoo has preserved samples of his ADN.</p>

<p>The house&#8217;s defining traits are a <strong>sun dial</strong>, an entrance with a semi-circular voussoir arch and a garden at the back with the <strong>tallest palm tree in Barcelona</strong>. It is 27 metres tall and dates from the 19th century.</p>
<h3>The last masia in barcelona</h3>
<p>The <i>masia </i>stands in an area rich in fast-flowing streams, where <strong>animal fodder and vegetables</strong> were sowed. The agricultural activity continued until the surrounding land was developed in 1987. Tenant farmers lived at Can Verdaguer until 2006, when Barcelona City Council acquired the farmhouse with the aim of converting it into a <strong>neighbourhood facility </strong>in the Porta area.</p>

It became the Escola Thalita school in 1956, which followed the Montessori teaching method.

<p>After the <strong>Escola de Puericultura</strong> childcare school closed down, the building gradually fell into disrepair, until the property was taken over by Barcelona City Council in 2004.  The new owners began the building&#8217;s renovation and transformation into a neighbourhood facility. The first step was to restore the gardens, and then renovation work was undertaken to turn Vil·la Florida into Sant Gervasi&#8217;s new civic centre. The renovation involved conserving the main building, but replacing non-original additions with functional features from the first floor up. All the <strong>architectural barriers have been eliminated </strong>and communication between the interior areas and the gardens have been improved.</p>
<h3>A reference for a healthy lifestyle</h3>
<p>The Vil·la Florida Civic Centre is now <strong>well-known for </strong>the promotion of healthy lifestyles, healthy eating and the habits of quality consumerism. It offers <strong>an extensive programme </strong>of workshops, activities and cultural cycles for all ages. It has a multimedia room, a lounge area, a balcony vegetable garden and a café-restaurant service with access to the garden.</p>

<p>Built on the remains of a medieval tower that was owned by the <strong>Baron of Creixell</strong>, the Can Basté <em>masia</em> [farmhouse] was already part of the old village of Santa Eulàlia de Vilapicina in the seventeenth century, and the historic site in Carrer de Pere d’Artés still stands to this day. The <em>masia</em> is named after the family that owned it in the eighteenth century, and they renovated and extended it, giving it the stately appearance it still has today. It is a striking detached building with an <strong>etched façade</strong> and a bridge that connects it to the church of Santa Eulàlia de Vilapicina.</p>
<p>The <em>masia</em> had several other owners until it became a <strong>public civic centre</strong> in 1995. Having been witness to a past of which little remains today, its <strong>historic value </strong>and the fact that is<strong> open to all </strong>make this building one of the most iconic and most beloved in the district.</p>
<h3>Traces of yesterday</h3>
<p>Can Basté is one of the few <em>masias</em> in Nou Barris to have survived the passage of time. When Barcelona City Council commissioned its restoration in 1991, <strong>archaeological excavations</strong> were carried out and this led to the discovery of a number of important medieval elements including a notable <strong>square-mouth silo</strong>.</p>
<p>Listed as a <strong>site of local cultural interest </strong>and converted into a civic centre, today Can Basté plays a major role in the <strong>cultural and local life</strong> of the area, and it is a welcoming place that is open to all.</p>

<h3>A truly local multinational company</h3>
<p>The relationship between the publishing house and the Coll neighbourhood, where it was established, became so close that their <strong>growth </strong>cannot be explained separately. Many Coll residents worked at Bruguera and several local neighbourhood businesses depended on the publishing house either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Bruguera giant dissolved in 1986 due to serious economic difficulties. Today, the building that housed the first workshops is home to the <strong>El Coll – La Bruguera Civic Centre, </strong>a popular centre that is fighting to keep alive the memories of a time when characters such as Zipi and Zape, Doña Urraca, Rompetechos or Superlópez were the indisputable kings of the newsagent’s kiosk.</p>
<p>The project to recover the historical memory of the former Bruguera publishing house is being promoted by the Gràcia district. The aim is to recover and preserve <strong>the oral and documentary heritage</strong> of its former workers and to share this heritage through the active participation of several local associations that organise exhibitions or roundtable discussions. </p>

<p><strong>Very elegant </strong>and with looks more reminiscent of a Parisian apartment building than a textile factory, it has a <strong>sloping roof and attics </strong>below to make better use of space, as well as facades with <strong>large windows </strong>opening up to the street. This allows light to enter all four of the factory&#8217;s floors.</p>
<h3>A neighbourhood space</h3>
<p>The factory closed its doors in 1978, and years later, in 1991, reopened as a <strong>municipal space </strong>open to all the local residents<strong>.</strong> It includes the <strong>Centre Cívic Can Felipa </strong>community centre, that offers a great number of multidisciplinary activities, <strong>Poblenou&#8217;s historic archives</strong>, a municipal sports centre and other facilities open to the public. A meeting point and crucial place for the local people, Can Felipa is today a place to <strong>enjoy culture </strong>whilst coexisting with the city&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>An important local<strong> meeting point</strong> and cultural centre, the Can Deu Civic Centre stands in Plaça de la Concòrdia, in the heart of <strong>Les Corts</strong> district. This lovely building, which has served its present purpose since 1984, was the home of the wealthy <strong>Deu family</strong> until 1929, and formerly stood in an <strong>area of vineyards</strong>.</p>
<p>Can Deu is a <strong>Neo-Gothic mansion</strong> built by the architect Eduard Mercader i Sacancha in the <strong>late nineteenth century</strong>. The building features many elements typical of those times, such as wrought-iron work and the balcony that runs all along one side. The latest alterations, which mainly affected the interior, were carried out by <strong>Barcelona</strong> <strong>City Council in 1984 </strong>when it was decided to convert the building into a civic centre. </p>
<h3>A centre with something for everyone</h3>
<p>The <strong>age-old air</strong> of Can Deu, which the locals are determined to conserve, can be appreciated throughout the site, particularly in the magnificent <strong>vintagecafé</strong>, a delightful space with <strong>white marble tables</strong> and large stained-glass windows that open onto the building&#8217;s enchanting gardens. Here, too, tables are provided for those who want a snack and a moment’s rest and relaxation.</p>
<p>Today, housing the neighbourhood’s social centre, Can Deu continues to play a role that it has played for many years: that of a <strong>key site for</strong> <strong>cultural activity in Les Corts district</strong>.</p>

<h3>From chalet to libertarian university</h3>
<p>Anarchists took over the Golferichs family home in 1936 and set up a <strong>popular university</strong> there, a sign of things to come: today&#8217;s Golferichs&#8217; chalet is one of the <strong>most active civic centres in the Eixample</strong> district, with a very full programme of courses, workshops, talks and exhibitions &#8211;<strong> pure culture</strong>. When the war was over, the house passed into the hands of a religious order that set up a school there until it was bought, at the end of the 1960s, <strong>by a construction that </strong>planned to knock it down and build a block of flats. However, the <strong>reaction of the residents</strong> was so strong, even going as far as occupying the place, that the City Council <strong>reclaimed ownership of the building, </strong>refurbished it and set up a civic centre in 1989: a little paradise at the heart of the Esquerra de l’Eixample neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The magnificent square building that houses the Torre Llobeta civic centre embodies part of the history of the district of Nou Barris in which it is located. The <strong>origins</strong> of Torre Llobeta date back to<strong> the fifteenth century</strong>, when it was built as a <strong>stately home</strong>. Surrounded by a large stretch of agricultural land, it was later converted into a <em>masia (farmhouse),</em> and is it is now one of Barcelona’s oldest preserved buildings. </p>
<p>The building is in perfect state of repair and many Gothic elements still remain today, including the <strong>large decorated windows</strong> on the facade, the <strong>lancet-arch doorway, </strong>the courtyard and the interior staircase, and for this reason it was declared a <strong>site of local cultural interest in Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>Good use of a heritage space</h3>
<p>Torre Llobeta was converted into a <strong>civic centre</strong> in 1983; today it is a space that is open to everyone and it offers music, cookery, language and theatre workshops as well as classes in traditional dances, such as the Sardana. Using this <strong>historic building</strong> to provide quality public services to the neighbourhood has seen Torre Llobeta become a place much loved by locals and one that is very necessary for them, it cannot be dissociated from the past and present history of the Nou Barris district.</p>

<p>As a clear symbol of the <strong>community and popular spirit</strong> which has always been characteristic of the neighbourhood of Gràcia, Plaça de la Sedeta houses the <strong>civic centre</strong> of the same name which has been organising most of the <strong>cultural life</strong> of the area since 1984, with workshops, courses, concerts, etc.</p>
<p>In historical terms, the<strong> industrial brick building</strong> occupying 7,000 square metres that now houses the civic centre was formerly a <strong>textile factory</strong> that was officially called <strong>Pujol i Casacuberta</strong>, even though it was known locally as La Sedeta, a name which was later given to the square that housed it.</p>
<h3>An emblematic civic centre</h3>
<p>Framed within a <strong>spirit of the struggle for rights</strong>, the square was always linked to this factory, and during the<strong> tram strike in 1951</strong> it was the first to stop production. In 1978, the square also bore witness to an <strong>intense local residents&#8217; campaign</strong> to save the factory building, which was to be demolished to make way for flats. Eventually the City Council bought it and it was destined for public use.</p>
<p>It is worth paying a visit to the centre of <strong>Camp d’en Grassot</strong>, which is filled with local residents and young people taking part in the civic centre activities, and discovering one of the <strong>most interesting squares </strong>in Barcelona in historical terms.</p>

<p><strong>Eduardo Conde Jiménez </strong>(Madrid 1840-Sarrià 1914) was the builder and owner of <i>El Siglo</i>, a well-known department store that occupied a seven-storey building at Nº 5<strong> Rambla dels Estudis</strong>.

In 1970, the nuns sold the convent&#8217;s land, but the chapel was acquired by Barcelona City Council. After remaining closed for a long period, restoration work began in 1998, giving the chapel its present-day appearance. The same year, the centre joined Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>civic-centre network</strong>, having been named after Pere Pruna as a tribute to the artist.</p>
<h3>Contemporary art and music</h3>
<p>The Pere Pruna Civic Centre is home to the district&#8217;s <strong>Choir Board</strong>. This body organises and programmes <i>La primavera coral</i> (the Choral Spring), the <i>Cycle of Religious Music</i> and the <i>Cycle of Youth Concerts,</i> in collaboration with various music schools. It also participates in other <strong>musical and artistic activities</strong>. The centre also manages the programming and registrations for the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district&#8217;s Literary Routes.</p>

<h3>Boosting trade</h3>
<p>One of the Eix Maragall&#8217;s most characteristic features is the <strong>perfect union</strong> that exists between its street and Horta market retailers, which sets it apart from other centres of business.  The organisation&#8217;s work is aimed at stimulating neighbourhood life through <strong>activities and promotions</strong> that are highly attractive to consumers. The associated businesses also delegate to the Eix the negotiations with the various administrations and benefit from services and discounts.</p>

<p>As part of the urban transformation and regeneration Poblenou is experiencing, Can Ricart has recently been turned into a space that can be used by the <strong>Universitat de Barcelona (UB)</strong>, which can now expand its facilities in this unique building.</p>
<h3>Pole of innovation</h3>
<p>The acquisition of Can Ricart means the UB, the oldest university in the city and one of the most important, will be able to expand its <strong>audiovisual communication, library and information science campus</strong>, for masters and postgraduate studies, by 10,000 square metres.</p>
<p>This future university centre in <strong>22@</strong>, an area which acts as a pole of innovation, will give a new, modern, contemporary face to university education in Barcelona. And the technological character of this district will encourage the development of <strong>new applied technologies</strong>.</p>

<p>The Creative Research Park provides creative people with the chance of finding head-hunters to <strong>sponsor </strong>their mobile and tablet applications, prototype designs, ideas for shows, audiovisual projects and other initiatives, so that they can turn them into real products and services.</p>
<p>In addition to providing support for creative talent, the Creative Research Park also fosters<strong> public participation </strong><strong> </strong> in the neighbourhood, through social and cultural initiatives.</p>
<h3> Recycling and architectural memory</h3>
<p>Adapting old buildings to new uses and defending their history is not just a passing trend: It is, in essence, the duty of today&#8217;s society. In this sense, Barcelona has some fine examples of <strong>architectural recycling</strong>, one of which is this former dog track, now transformed into a public facility.</p>
<p>Designed by Antoni Bonet Castellana, the building is an impressive iron structure, inspired by the industrial aesthetics of the 1950s. It won the <strong>FAD Design prize</strong> in the same year it was officially opened in: 1964. The Canòdrom or Dog Track held greyhound races up to 2006.</p>

<p>The importance of Casa de l’Aigua, a leading environmental centre and new central hub for economic promotion, lies in its architectural clarity and type of construction. It is, in fact, <strong>one of the first buildings in Barcelona</strong> <strong>to have been constructed with reinforced concrete</strong>. The Modernista complex, a work designed by the <strong>engineers Felip Steva i Planas and Joan Sitjes</strong>, is included in the city&#8217;s heritage catalogue.</p>
<p>Closed back in 1989, the complex originally consisted of a lift station situated in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood; chlorination pavilions and a tank located in Trinitat Nova, and an underground tunnel that connected both facilities and extended towards Collserola.</p>
<h3>A new space</h3>
<p>These days the complex, which in the past played a vital role in Barcelona&#8217;s history by supplying it with one of the most valuable assets for our survival, has become a place where local people can cultivate their allotments and given back the district the rural, farming origins it has always had. Today, Casa de l’Aigua is a facility of great heritage value and a great place for holding city events that are open to everyone.</p>

<p>Like so many other convents in Barcelona, for example, Sant Josep and Santa Caterina, which once stood on sites today occupied by markets that have adopted their names, the Capuchin convent was destroyed during the confiscation and sale of Church lands in the 19th century. A large, rectangular <strong>porticoed square</strong>, surrounded by Neoclassical buildings, was built on the vacant site between 1848 and 1859. Following the design of the <strong>Plaza Mayor</strong> in Madrid the architect, Molina, conceived a neat, elegant square that would have a portico with a Catalan vault, supported by a semicircular arch, and Isabelline facades with Corinthian pilasters and balconies.</p>
<p>Plaça Reial is just a stone&#8217;s throw from the <strong>Liceu</strong> opera house, the ultimate symbol of bourgeois Barcelona, and for many years it was the nerve centre of the city&#8217;s business powers.</p>
<h3>Meeting point</h3>
<p>Today the haughty character of times gone by has given way to a more popular feel and the square has become one of the busiest in Barcelona. Its terraces offer locals and tourists who pass through the chance to take a pleasant break for a drink or a bite to eat, while the archways shelter bars, clubs and concert halls.</p>
<p>The square conceals a few other treasures too: the two <strong>street lamps with six arms</strong> are the work of a young Antoni Gaudí, while the cast-iron Fountain of the Three Graces is by Antoni Rovira i Trias and dates from 1876. And last but not least, on Carrer del Vidre is the oldest herbalist&#8217;s in Barcelona and probably in the whole of Catalonia: the <strong>Herboristeria del Rei</strong>, a shop that has remained immune to the passage of time for almost two centuries.</p>

<p>Granja Vella de Martí Codolar is a Salesian seminary and residence that you can visit or where you can stay for a short retreat. It was <strong>formerly an agricultural</strong> estate with a residential mansion, and in addition to its location in an idyllic corner of Barcelona, it is also steeped in history.</p>
<p>The origin of the estate dates back to the 17th century, when the Horta-Guinardó district was predominantly rural and the <strong>Can Gausachs farmhouse </strong>was built. It remained as it was until the property was bought in the 18th century by the <strong>Milà de la Roca family</strong>,who turned the farmhouse into a <strong>French-style manor house</strong> in the early 19th century. However, it wasn’t until the middle of the 19th century that the next owner, <strong>Lluís Martí Codolar</strong>, and his family filled the gardens with exotic animals, giving rise to <strong>Barcelona’s first zoo</strong>.</p>
<h3>An eclectic environment</h3>
<p>The Granja Vella was transferred to the <strong>Congregation of the Salesians </strong>in 1946 because of the <strong>close</strong> <strong>friendship </strong>that <strong>Lluís Martí Codolar</strong> had developed with <strong>Joan Bosco</strong>, which he extended to the Salesians of Sarrià. Granja Vella de Martí Codolar’s rural setting, religious mysticism and <strong>stately elegance </strong>are a subtle, <strong>harmonious</strong> combination that continues to inspire awe to this day.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A pioneering hospital</h3>
<p>The old La Maternitat <strong>hospital complex</strong> in the <strong>Les Corts</strong> district is very close to Camp Nou. Nowadays, this <strong>Modernista complex</strong>, formed by a number of pavilions, not only serves as a <strong>hospital </strong>but is also home to other institutions such as the <strong>Archives of the Provincial Council of Barcelona</strong>, the <strong>National University of Distance Education</strong>, a primary healthcare centre, a school, etc. Highlights include the buildings of the <strong>blue pavilion </strong>and the <strong>pink pavilion</strong>. Its biggest attraction, which delight both locals and visitors alike, are the <strong>gardens open</strong> to the public, which merge nature with architecture in a unique way. Features include the statue <strong><em>La maternitat</em></strong>, by sculptor Lluïsa Granero.</p>
<p> Built on the <strong>Can Cavaller</strong> estate in the late 19th century, the initial project for the structure of the complex and the pavilions, most of which are Modernista in style, was entrusted to <strong>Camil Oliveres i Cansaran</strong>, at the time the <strong>Provincial Council architect</strong>, who distributed the buildings throughout the space in accordance with the most advanced healthcare standards of the day. Following his death, the project was taken on by other architects. The buildings are made from exposed brick and decorated with <strong>polychrome ceramics </strong>in a synthesis of aesthetics and functionality typical of this architectural style.</p>
<h3>Solidarity and care for the disadvantaged</h3>
<p>The history of this complex is of great <strong>social and architectural value</strong>, as its aim was to provide care and assistance to the <strong>most disadvantaged people </strong>of that era: abandoned children and &#8220;secret&#8221; mothers. Because of the aims of the institution, the gardens were designed to try to make the sick people&#8217;s stay as pleasant as possible so, today, visitors are able to enjoy the numerous species of trees found in the park, such as the tall date palms and what is probably the <strong>tallest magnolia tree in Barcelona</strong>, measuring more than twelve metres tall and fifteen metres wide. La Maternitat is a <strong>historical site </strong>that is full of charm where visitors can relax and observe the comings and goings of the neighbourhood from beneath the shade of the trees.</p>

<h3>Recycled buildings</h3>
<p>At the end of 2008, the Swedish company H&amp;M opened a new branch in the building, giving it a radically new use to that which it had had up to this point. For some time a number of clothing companies were vying for the property thanks to its strategic location and spectacular look.</p>

<p>The Rec Comtal took water from Montcada i Reixac, crossed the whole of Ciutat Vella and emptied into the sea. It is known that it was cleaned regularly and that many bridges crossed it over almost <strong>12 kilometres</strong>, the distance it covered. The side walls were made of stone from Montjuïc and the bottom from natural earth. Visitors to the Born Centre Cultural can see the remains of its passage though the Ribera quarter.</p>
<h3>Strolling through history</h3>
<p>Today the open stretch of the Rec Comtal flows through a peaceful <strong>green setting</strong>, away from the bustle of the city. The clear water is home to fish, frogs, ducks and swans.</p>

<p>The hundred-year-old houses along Carrer de Sants are simple homes, <strong>nothing like the opulent Modernisme </strong>on Passeig de Gràcia. One example is Casa Jaume Estrada at nº 54, which was built in 1906 and stands out for the column of bay windows on the corner and its stained-glass windows. Another is Casa Miquel Tuset at nº 130, which was built between 1911 and 1914 and combines late Modernista features with other styles. At nº 145, Casa Consol Grassot (1902), the bay windows and the wrought ironwork of the balconies catch your eye, whereas nº 149, Casa Tomàs Vendrell (1900-1908), has an eclectic style. And nº 151, Casa M. Araceli Fabra i Puig (1903-1905) has a unique ringed column at the corner.</p>
<h3>A touch of history</h3>
<p>Carrer de Sants was the road that linked <strong>Barcelona to Madrid</strong>. It was built in 1790, and shops and houses were added during the 19th century, before it was swallowed up by Barcelona with the incorporation of the old town of Sants into the city in 1897.</p>

<p>The 3,000 peasants who sparked the reapers&#8217; revolt against military abuses headed for Barcelona, staging their protests at that old chapel, where the figure of the <strong>Sant Crist dels Segadors</strong> has been venerated ever since. Its origins go back to the 15th and 16th centuries but it was incorporated into the Sant Andreu de Palomar Church in 1846, when building work started on the new parish church. It was set on fire during <strong>Tragic Week</strong> and suffered further damage during the Spanish Civil. Only <strong>its structure remains</strong>, where you can now see traces of its altarpieces and imagery as well as the original floor. The chapel is closed to the public. Several proposals have been made to turn it into a <i>Guerra dels Segadors</i> (Reapers&#8217; War) information centre.</p>

<p>Barcelona was bombed by the <strong>German and Italian air forces </strong>during the Spanish Civil War. As a result, the Generalitat&#8217;s <strong>Junta</strong> <strong>de Defensa Passiva </strong>(Passive Defence Committee) commissioned the engineer <strong>Ramon Perera</strong> with designing a system that would enable to the population to take shelter from the attacks. Perera proposed the construction of underground shelters that could be accessed by steps from a block of flats or the street.</p>
<p>They were constructions crowned with exposed-brick <strong>Catalan vaults</strong> to resist the force of the bombs and with zigzag entrances to protect them from the blast waves. This was an advanced design for <strong>passive defence </strong>which proved effective because, according to historians, there are no records of fatalities in these shelters.</p>
<h3>Other shelters</h3>
<p>Barcelona has numerous shelters that can be visited and which allow us to discover what life was like for the city&#8217;s residents during the Civil War. Many used to shelter in <strong>metro and train</strong> stations and corridors too, such as the one at the <strong>Plaça de la Universitat</strong> station.</p>

<h3>Unregistered shelters</h3>
<p>The La Lira shelter only had one entrance, contrary to the regulations, making it unfit for official registration with the Generalitat&#8217;s <strong>Junta de Defensa Passiva </strong>(Passive Defence Committee).

<p>Can Culleretes was a success story from the day the first owner began to serve meals. She was the doorkeeper of a nearby convent, outside the walls, close to Plaça de Sant Jaume. This lady began to serve her drinks and meals through a window. She produced a home-made <i>mató</i>, a kind of cottage cheese, that was said to be delicious. It was a resounding success: she left the her position at the convent to open a restaurant in Carrer d’en Quintana. There are many stories about where the name originated: some people say it comes from the fact that it was the first place to use metal spoons, but others claim it was the cry of the waiter continually shouting for spoons to serve the ten diners who just fit inside the restaurant.</p>
<h3>Cannelloni and home-made desserts</h3>
<p>The restaurant still preserves some tiles from the late eighteenth century and is today an establishment recognised for the excellence of its dishes such as cannelloni and home-made desserts.</p>

And inside you begin your journey back to bohemia: it is an intimate space featuring a <strong>huge marble bar </strong>where at one end rests the forged iron sculpture of the muse from the <strong>Universal Exposition of 1888</strong>.The <strong>imposing wooden shelving unit </strong>behind the bar, housing ancient bottles, is another Modernista trait that has<strong> </strong>remained intact throughout the years.</p>
<h3>The energy of days gone by</h3>
<p>It is not easy to find someone from Barcelona who does not know what Casa Almirall is: these days the bar continues to be frequented by locals and the spaces retains its ground-breaking spirit. From time to time cultural activities from silent cinema screenings to social gatherings are held here.Just as they were in days gone by.</p>

<h3>The end of an era</h3>
<p>The farmland was bordered by today&#8217;s Passeig de Valldaura, Plaça de Karl Marx and, to the south, the Can Peguera stream. After the war much of the land was broken up and sold off, and the fields turned into dozens of houses, then known as the <strong>Can Carreras neighbourhood</strong>, which has now disappeared. <strong>Barcelona City Council took over the building </strong>in the 1990s, to include it in Parc Central in Nou Barris.</p>
<p>The work carried out included remodelling the area around the house and planting an olive tree at the door of the old manor, in memory of the former city councillor, <strong>Antoni Santiburcio</strong>, who was behind the Parc Central project. Today Can Carreras is pending plans to turn it into a <strong>new neighbourhood facility</strong>.</p>

<h3>An extension programme</h3>
<p>The project to extend the Les Aigües road is currently awaiting approval. It affects the stretch that passes by the <strong>Bacallà Fountain</strong> and will enable uninterrupted connection of the town of Esplugues de Llobregat with Torre Baró. <strong>A steel footbridge</strong>, four and a half metres wide and 157 metres long, will span the Carretera d&#8217;Arrabassada. The project also includes <strong>improvements to 800 metres of the area prior to</strong> the footbridge, to<strong> </strong>adjust the width to that of the rest of the promenade. The aim is to <strong>ensure</strong> that walkers and cyclists can move about freely in both directions.</p>

<h3>An architect going against the flow</h3>
<p><strong>Josep Antoni Coderch</strong> (1913-1984) was a unique architect. His work was far ahead of its time, very modern and yet very respectful towards local building traditions.He came to fame in 1952, with the resounding success of the pavilion he designed for the 9th Triennial of Milan. He was also a member of <strong>Team 10</strong>, the renowned international group of architects who set the tone of western architecture in the second half of the twentieth century.In fact, Coderch is considered by many experts to be the true driving force behind the <strong>renaissance of Spanish </strong>architecture in the post-war period.</p>

Walking there today lets you relive a small reminder of its golden past.

<p>The square was <strong>remodelled several times</strong> during the last century. It is partially paved and retains a patch of sand in the middle. The last redevelopment, in 2000, gave it the look it has now, somewhere between a park and a garden with two levels, a mixture of paving and sand, surrounded by tipuanas with patches of grass on one side. You can still see a <strong>fountain with a Doric column</strong> there, with a relief of the old coat of arms, from when this was a town, separate from Barcelona.</p>

The Sant Joan church, a very simple building, is from that period. You can still see the Modernista-style <strong>Santíssim chapel</strong> inside . At one end of the square there is a striking sculpture, <i>Ruth</i>, by Josep Maria Camps.</p>
<h3>A square that gives pedestrians right of way</h3>
<p>This is one of the favourite squares for Gràcia&#8217;s residents and it is always very crowded. Cars can only pass through on one side, so it is very peaceful. It is near Carrer de Torrijos, where you will find the <strong>Verdi Park</strong> <strong>cinema</strong>.</p>

<p>Plaça de la Rovira is the <strong>nerve centre</strong> of the upper part of Gràcia. It is a small square, full of charm and shops. It is also known as <strong><i>Plaça dels Tres Senyors</i></strong>, the square of the three owners of the rural lands surrounding it when Gràcia was still a village: Messrs Torrente, Masens and Rabassa. It was they who commissioned Gràcia&#8217;s municipal architect, Antoni Rovira i Trias, with <strong>developing the square</strong>, housing included.</p>
<h3>A prolific architect</h3>
<p>Rovira i Trias, a resident of Gràcia, was the architect of <strong>many of Barcelona&#8217;s markets</strong>, among other things, such as the Born, Concepció, Sant Antoni and Barceloneta markets. He was also responsible for <strong>planning the town, Vila</strong> de Gràcia, packed with narrow streets and numerous squares. Hence the square&#8217;s memorial to him, a life-size <strong>bronze sculpture</strong>. At his feet, you can see a map with his design for the Eixample, which won the public competition organised by the City Council in 1859 but finally lost to another project, which Madrid imposed, designed by the urban planner Ildefons Cerdà.</p>

<h3>End of the journey</h3>
<p>The architect, who was famous for having designed the Arc de Triomf, channelled all the artistic baggage he had acquired over the years into this project That is why this totally <strong>eclectic</strong> work freely combines the basic forms of a medieval castle with purely Modernista elements, such as the use of the parabolic arc at the entrance or the glazed ceramic material on the roof of the tower. The extensive ornamentation mixes Mudejar, Gothic and Art Nouveau features.</p>

One curious feature is the building on the corner with Carrer de Cornet i Mas. This used to be the <strong>Institut Colon</strong>, a prestigious secondary school which then had the young nationalist politician <strong>Francesc Cambó</strong> as one of its teachers. Nowadays the building houses a nursery school. It has been an educational centre for over a hundred years.</p>
<h3>The most picturesque square</h3>
<p>The stone statue of Sant Vicenç has <strong>presided over the square since 1896</strong>. It used to be opposite the Vila de Sarrià church. The name of its sculptor is unknown, but it has been attributed to Nicolau Travé, who worked in Barcelona in the second half of the 18th century.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Plaça de Sant Vicenç is one of the nicest, quietest places in the city. It is also one of the favourite scenes for local and visiting artists.</p>

<p>The small, semi-covered passage takes its name from the stockbroker <strong>Josep Mallofré i Trius</strong>, who bought an old barracks that was being used as a garage for a transport company&#8217;s vehicles. After knocking down the existing buildings, he built <strong>three new houses</strong>: one on Carrer Major de Sarrià, another on Clos de Sant Francesc and a third one in the interior, so that they formed a passage that could be used as a shortcut between the two main streets.</p>
<h3>The charm of old sarrià</h3>
<p>The passage has all the charm of the old Sarrià, and is considered <strong>to be one of the most unusual places </strong>in Barcelona. On top of that, it is very close to the house where the poet, journalist and essayist <strong>Josep Vicenç Foix i Mas </strong>(1893-1987) was born. He was one of the most outstanding figures of the Catalan avant-garde. And his family&#8217;s famous patisserie Foix de Sarrià, founded in 1866, is at Nº 57 Carrer Major de Sarrià.</p>

<h3>A hopeful future</h3>
<p>Barcelona City Council and local residents&#8217; associations want to turn Petita Maria into a centre for neighbourhood <strong>facilities</strong>. There are a lot of associations interested in this but a big financial investment is required because the entire building needs to be rebuilt.</p>

<h3>The elegance of the bay window</h3>
<p>The most important feature of the building is the facade, dominated by a <strong>central bay window </strong>that stands out from the greenish surface covered in sgraffito. The<strong> combination of wood and leaded glass</strong> is a formal solution, different from the one normally applied to Modernista buildings in the Eixample, and that&#8217;s what makes it so original.</p>
<p>Another outstanding feature is the <strong>wrought ironwork of the balcony balustrades</strong> with the <strong>intricate, naturalistic shapes</strong> so characteristic of Modernisme. The same may be said of the roof terrace balustrade, an undulating cornice in shape.</p>

<p>He designed numerous buildings intended as <strong>residences for the middle and working classes.</strong> Other notable examples besides this are his buildings on Carrer de Mallorca (184-188) and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes (582), which are often referred to as Granell houses as well.</p>

<p>Joaquim Ros i Bofarull (Barcelona, 1906-1991) was a sculptor and xylographer, trained by masters such as the painter Francesc d’Assís Galí and the sculptor Pau Gargallo. Ros&#8217;s works are in the <strong>Noucentista-style</strong> and tend towards <strong>stylisation</strong>. He collaborated in the work on the Mare de Déu throne (1947) for the Montserrat monastery. He also created the groups <i>Adoration of the Kings and Adoration of the Shepherds</i> for the Birth facade of the <strong>Sagrada Família</strong> (1981-1982). As a xylographer he is one of the <strong>exponents of Catalan Noucentista</strong> engraving. The family donated the artist&#8217;s prints, documents and photographs to the Library of Catalonia.</p>

On the symmetrical facade there are three balconies on the first floor and three windows on the second, while square stone blocks decorate the bays and protrude from the facade.

<p>These are three-storey buildings. The ground floor has a stone facade and the green finish starts on the main floor, from which some <strong>enormous balconies</strong> protrude. The architectural complex continues at the chamfer with Carrer de Concepció Arenal. There, the balconies curve over a blind wall crowned with a Baroque-style <strong>coat of arms in relief</strong>. Although the interior is not open to the public, because the buildings are divided into private flats, it is still worthwhile to take a good look at the outside.</p>

<p>Listed as a Cultural Asset of Local Interest (BCIL) and an eloquent example of Sant Andreu de Palomar&#8217;s rural past, this three-storey farmhouse with a <strong>neoclassical facade</strong> was built between 1650 and 1651, at the height of the Guerra dels Segadors, or Reapers&#8217; War. It was altered in 1825, by Jaume Oliveras, when sides were added with Italian renaissance-style porticoed galleries and terraces. The property was looked after by the <strong>Feliubadaló family</strong> from its origins to 1900. When they left the farmhouse, a canning factory moved in and used it until it was bought by the industrialist Valentí Iglesias.</p>
<h3>From farmhouse to outdoor school</h3>
<p>Les Carasses became a school during the Second Spanish Republic, in 1931. It was a coeducational school based on <strong>outdoor education</strong> and contact with nature. As it was surrounded by gardens and woods, and had an allotment at the back, classes were often held outside in the summer. It was named after the poet Ignasi Iglésias, who was born in Sant Andreu de Palomar.</p>

In the early 1990s the market, by then in a state of disrepair, was pulled down and the square restored, as an open space surrounded by porticoes supporting <strong>old blocks of flats </strong>that give the square the village look it had always had.</p>
<h3>Antique toy market</h3>
<p>An antique toy fair used to be held there but now it has moved to the remodelled <strong>Plaça de l’Assemblea de Catalunya</strong>. It is organised by the Agrupament Ferroviari de Barcelona and held on the first Sunday of every month.</p>

<p>This five-storey, terrace-roof building with a <strong>pale green facade</strong> stands out for its numerous typically Modernista features: winding balconies with <strong>wrought-iron balustrades</strong>, <i>trencadís</i> under the balconies, sgraffito on the facade and the rusticated corner finished off with a pinnacle. The house was built for the flour merchant and businessman Francesc Guardiola at the start of the  20th century, which is why it was known for many years as <strong>Casa d’en Guardiola</strong>. It is a listed building in the City Council&#8217;s heritage catalogue.</p>
<h3>Bar Versalles</h3>
<p>Casa Vidal, on Carrer Gran de Sant Andreu, is famous for a bar on the ground floor, the <strong>old Bar Versalles</strong>, founded in 1915. This site is currently occupied by a restaurant and the bar&#8217;s basement, once a cellar and storage room used as a shelter during the Spanish Civil War, is now a function room that holds all kinds of events.</p>

There was already a small settlement here in the 5th century and, long before that, in <strong>Roman times</strong>, the land was already being farmed. The church has a Gothic portal, while the rest of the facade and the bell tower are Barroque. In the tympanum you can make out <strong>St Martin (Sant Martí) of Tours</strong> but, unfortunately, the figure was lost when the church was burned in 1936.</p>

<p>Per square metre, Portal de l’Àngel is one of the most expensive streets in Spain: it is not surprisingly one of the most important commercial areas in the city, constantly bursting at the seams.

<p>Stay alert, whenever you&#8217;re on this street and look up, instead of fixing your gaze on shop windows. The avenue is home to several beautiful <strong>stately buildings packed with balconies and spotless façades</strong>. It is worth taking a pause opposite what was once the headquarters of the Gas Natural company, a Modernista building from the late nineteenth century designed by the architect Domenech i Estapà. If you keep your eyes peeled you can find a sculpture set in one of the façades that is dedicated to the guardian angel of the gateway.</p>

<p>Lined by palms &#8211; one of the most distinctive trees in Barcelona and with benches on both sides &#8211; the Rambla del Raval is a great place for escaping the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood&#8217;s inner side-streets and contemplating the coming and going of the people who pass by there every day. And that is because the promenade is never short of activity, not even at night, when its cafes and restaurants are packed with customers treated to a <strong>good selection of local and international cuisine </strong>. The Rambla del Raval is the home to local activities: lots of cultural activities are organised there, especially during the months of good weather. An example is the <strong>Raval Open Market</strong>, an urban-designer trade fair for finding unusual items made with heaps of imagination and creativity. The market is held during the summer weekends.</p>
<h3>Botero&#8217;s Cat</h3>
<p>The Colombian sculptor <strong>Fernando Botero</strong> created this enormous and very original bronze sculpture of a cat that welcomes people to the<strong> Rambla del Raval</strong> from C/ Sant Pau.</p>

<p>Next to Barcelona but a long way from the city pollution, Passeig de les Aigües is one of the favourite <strong>green spaces</strong> of Barcelona residents, for doing sport, walking or just enjoying the hills and the <strong>magnificent views</strong>. You can reach it by transport and the <strong>Vallvidrera funicular</strong>, which links the Peu de Funicular station with Vallvidrera, has a specific stop for this path.</p>
<p>Traditionally known as <strong>Carretera de les Aigües</strong>, it owes its name to the fact it was originally the road used to distribute water from the hills.</p>
<h3>Extension</h3>
<p>It runs from the <strong>Pedralbes neighbourhood</strong>, in the district of Les Corts, to the <strong>Penitents neighbourhood</strong>, in the district of Gràcia, but Passeig de les Aigües is currently being extended, to link it to the stretch that continues on the other side to <strong>Torre Baró</strong>, in the Nou Barris district. So, in the future, Passeig de les Aigües will be <strong>21 kilometres long</strong>, and there will be a new footbridge of 157 metres over Carretera de l’Arrabassada that will cut out the distance between the hills.</p>

<p>Even though they are separated from the <strong>Collserola range</strong> by the urban cluster, they seem like an extension of these mountains penetrating the city. Inhabited from ancient times, with <strong>farmhouses</strong> and <strong>vegetable plots</strong>, settlements and villages grew up around then that became neighbourhoods and which today are the <strong>best ways to get into</strong> this green lung in the middle of the city, like Guinardó, Font d’en Fargues, Can Baró and Carmel.</p>
<h3>Viewpoints and shelters</h3>
<p>In the 20th century, the Tres Turons neighbourhoods developed in a big way, welcoming a large number of immigrants and becoming the <strong>charming neighbourhoods</strong> they are today, with small steep streets landscaped areas and impressive views from many places. As they are located on hills, they have <strong>numerous viewpoints</strong>, like the one on <strong>Turó de la Rovira (now under construction), </strong>at a height of 269 m, where you can find the remains of the anti-aircraft guns that were positioned there in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>One of the most iconic parks in Tres Turons is <strong>Guinardó</strong>, a perfect spot which every weekend fills up with families that want to enjoy nature. The diverse trees and the well-known <strong>Cuento fountain</strong>, where it is said many couples met secretly, make this park a peaceful haven.</p>
<p>The <strong>small-town life</strong> that these neighbourhoods still have, with their small shops and open and simple residents, are the most authentic in working-class Barcelona. The <strong>green areas</strong> with parks that bring you close to nature and the <strong>impressive views</strong> from their lofty heights are a privilege for anyone who wants to really get to know the city.</p>

<p>Poblenou was a neighbourhood that was once so full of factories that it was referred to as the <strong>Catalan Manchester</strong>. But in the late 20th century it began a transformation that turned the former industrial areas into a land of innovation, known as <strong>22@.</strong> The installation of the UPF&#8217;s Communication Campus in one of the former <strong>manufacturing spaces</strong>, in 2009, contributed to the transformation of this modern neighbourhood, open to technology and with the will to become an area primarily dedicated to <strong>knowledge and innovation</strong>.</p>
<h3 class=\"title\">Campus of excellence</h3>
<p>The campus consists of a set of new buildings equipped with cutting-edge technology, and integrates within it the former <strong>Ca l’Aranyó textile factory</strong>, a very important building that is an example of Catalan industrial architecture from the late 19th century. This past is also preserved in an <strong>imposing chimney</strong>, which now stands in the central square of the campus where students read or chat in the shade.</p>
<p>The UPF, which in 2010 was given the Campus of International Excellence rating, is the university considered the most international in Spain and is among the fifteen major European universities. Incorporating the Communication Campus in the <strong>Poblenou neighbourhood </strong>signified the creation of a quality academic, scientific, entrepreneurial and innovative environment, both internationally oriented and socially integrated.</p>

It has been built according to the most demanding <strong>sustainability and efficiency</strong> criteria, and it is a model for Europe&#8217;s new architecture. The <em>skin</em> that covers the building is made from an innovative material, ETFE, which is different to glass, brick, wood or cement, an <strong>eco-efficient material</strong> that achieves perfect acclimatisation and energy savings above the world average.</p>
<h3>The centre of innovation</h3>
<p>A building with these characteristics could only house the most cutting-edge <strong>technological advances</strong> between its four walls. In fact, it brings together the <strong>information technology</strong> resources and services that will relaunch the Catalan economy towards a new business model: <strong>technological innovation</strong>. Mobile Start-Up, Corporate Start-up, the Cibernàrium digital training centre and the Mobile World Capital Foundation all have a space here, with the goal of turning Barcelona into the knowledge and innovation capital, and the Sant Martí district, formerly the Catalan Manchester, into the Mediterranean Silicon Valley. The <strong>digital revolution</strong> has already begun and the MediaTIC Building has welcomed it.</p>

<p>In 1929, in application of the Cheap Housing Act, a total of <strong>784 houses </strong>were built on this area of farmland (which did not then belong to Barcelona). These single-storey houses, measuring 40 square metres, were sold or let to immigrants from other parts of Spain, slum-dwellers and other poor people, providing accommodation for up to 3,000 residents. They were built on land that was affected by water-level fluctuations and were practically left to their fate. For this reason and despite the regeneration of the neighbourhood, we can still find examples here of <strong>popular architecture</strong> from the time when the residents repaired their houses and streets themselves.</p>
<h3>Children of Bon Pastor</h3>
<p>Bon Pastor has now been fully integrated into the district and the city. It has social, health, educational and sports facilities and, since 2010, its own metro station. The writer <strong>Jorge Larena</strong> and the footballer Sergio García are proud sons of the neighbourhood, and the musical trio <strong>Rumba Tres</strong>, who have been playing for 40 years, alsoemerged from the Cheap Houses, along with one of the neighbourhood’s best known <br /> activists, <strong>Salvador Angosto</strong>.</p>

<p>The resulting <strong>Besòs River Park, </strong>which opened in 2004,is a large area of parkland divided into three sections: wetlands (around Montcada i Reixac); an area for <strong>public use </strong> (shared by Sant Andreu, Santa Coloma and Sant Adrià); and the river mouth. The public area in Sant Andreu stretches from<strong> Trinitat Vella </strong><span>to the <strong> RCD Espanyol Sports City</strong> and provides locals with an area for walking, cycling and outdoor sports </span></p>
<h3>The bird park</h3>
<p>Thanks to the regeneration of the river, many natural habitats have also been recovered, and more than <strong>200 bird <strong>species </strong></strong>now inhabit the area. Other small mammals, such as mice and weasels, as well as other animals, including turtles and frogs, now inhabit the new river park.</p>

<p>At the foot of the Collserola mountains, <strong>Nou Barris</strong> has always contained infrastructure that is associated with Barcelona’s <strong>water supply,</strong> and thishas left a remarkable architectural legacy. The <strong>Ciutat Meridiana aqueduct</strong> is one of the most important examples of this legacy and it rises majestically over the district despite being no longer in use.</p>
<p>This waterway was part of the <strong>Baix Vallès aqueduct</strong>, which was designed by <strong>Andreu Marí </strong>and funded by the banker<strong> Manel Girona</strong>. It was built in the late nineteenth century, prompted by the fact that Barcelona was growing and the <strong>Comtal canal</strong> and wells were becoming insufficient to supply the city. The aqueduct <strong>was 18 kilometres long</strong> and diverted 1,700 cubic metres of water a day from the Ripoll and Caldes brooks.</p>
<h3>Reviving history</h3>
<p>Among the residential buildings that define Nou Barris today, the Ciutat Meridiana aqueduct stands out as one of the few remaining<strong> historic monuments </strong>in the district. For this reason, in 2012, the <strong>Mestre Morera</strong> <strong>School</strong> worked with the <strong>Museu d’Història de Barcelona</strong> on a joint project called <strong>“Patrimonia’m”</strong> which promoted the conservation of the Ciutat Meridiana aqueduct and recognised its historical significance.</p>

<h3>Instilling values</h3>
<p>The Mundet Campus specialises in the areas of <strong>Education, Psychology and Pedagogy</strong> and accommodates over <strong>10,000 users </strong>every day, including students, faculty members and administrative staff.

<p>The UPF, which began life in 1990, spreads its teaching over three campuses, including that of Ciutadella, which is focused on the social sciences and humanities.</p>
<p>Located in the <strong>Vila Olímpica </strong>neighbourhood, next to Ciutadella Park and Barcelona Zoo, it was set up in this area as a result of the urban regeneration that came to the city in the wake of the Olympic Games, and breathed new life into <strong>three historical buildings </strong>that had fallen into disuse.</p>
<h3>dings with history</h3>
<p>Two of these three buildings, known as Jaume I and Roger de Llúria, owe their origin to the <strong>military barracks </strong>constructed in 1887. The third, the <strong>Dipòsit de les Aigües</strong>, had been built some years before and inaugurated in 1880 to regulate the flow of water to the waterfall in Ciutadella park and irrigate the gardens. Designed by architect <strong>Josep Fontserè </strong>the construction is identical to a Roman prototype, comprising a maze of <strong>14-metre-high </strong>parallel arches, which intersect in a barrel vault and spread out with a mirror effect along its 65 metres. <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, then a young architecture student, contributed to the project by doing the calculations for the support elements. Today, transformed into the <strong>UPF&#8217;s General Library</strong>, the Dipòsit de les Aigües offers impressive reading rooms where students can consult the entire <strong>catalogue</strong>, and which includes, among other things, the collections from the Haas Library, Barcelona&#8217;s Chamber of Commerce, and the Jaume Vicens Vives University Institute of History, which is also located in this building.</p>

<p>Amid the area known as 22@ rise numerous chimneys that remind us of the industrial past of this neighbourhood, which in the late nineteenth century was referred to as the <strong>Catalan Manchester</strong>. One of the chimneys, standing at eight metres tall, is currently part of the UPF&#8217;s Communication Campus. It is next to the building which belonged to the former Ca l’Aranyó factory. Now reclaimed and transformed into a space for the university, this building is one of the best examples of <strong>Catalan industrial heritage</strong>.</p>
<h3>A British legacy</h3>
<p>Dedicated to the <strong>production of cotton</strong>, Ca l’Aranyó belonged to the Catalan businessman Claudi Aranyó and functioned right up to 1986, when it fell into disrepair. It was reclaimed in order to retain its <strong>unique typology</strong>, as Ca l’Aranyó is different to all other examples of Catalan textile architecture from the 19th century.</p>
<p>The building was constructed in 1878 and designed according to the <strong>English </strong>model of <strong>industrial architecture</strong>. So it is the only floored factory in Catalonia where a <strong>metallic structure,</strong> a British signature, was adapted to the traditional Catalan vault. The mixture of these two styles, as well as the use of exposed brickwork as the main material, makes it unique and very attractive.</p>

<p>The strong wall round the city stayed the same for almost a <strong>thousand years</strong>, until James l ordered it to be expanded in the 13th century. For centuries the city remained within the confines of this wall, which formed an <strong>elongated </strong>octagon and, broadly speaking, occupied the area squeezed between Plaça de la Catedral and Carrer d’en Gignàs, from north to south, and between Carrer del Sotstinent Navarro and Carrer d’Avinyó, from east to west.</p>
<h3>Sections revealed</h3>
<p>Fragments are still visible in the Barri Gòtic and you can even retrace a large part of it. <strong>Plaça Nova</strong>, to the right of the Cathedral, is good point to start to see the remains of the wall. <strong>Four towers </strong>have been preserved, two in the Casa de l’Ardiaca, the archdeacon&#8217;s house, and two more either side of Carrer del Bisbe, which flanked one of the four entrances into the old <strong>Roman town</strong>.</p>
<p>From there you need to continue along Avinguda de la Catedral and go down Via Laietana, where, in Plaça de Ramon Berenguer, you can see a good stretch of wall, on top of which the 14th century Gothic Chapel of Santa Àgueda now stands. At the foot of the wall there are also the remains of the <strong>original moat</strong>, which played a defensive role but also served as a sewer. The path of the wall continues towards the sea, with some sections revealed, others being unearthed, and yet others hidden by buildings, until it reaches Plaça dels Traginers, where another imposing tower can be found. From there the wall continued to the sea gate, <strong>Porta del Mar</strong>, the remains of which can currently be seen inside the Pati Llimona Civic Centre Outside and backing onto the walls is where the dockside Roman baths were built. These have recently been rediscovered and are worth a visit.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Present and future</h3>
<p>Traditionally a Line 1 (L1) <strong>metro station</strong>, La Sagrera has, over the years, become a <strong>very important</strong> transport hub, especially for the <strong>&nbsp;northern part of Barcelona</strong>. It is a busy place, with a metro, suburban and regional train services that many Barcelona residents use every day.</p>
<p>And since the arrival of the high-speed train <strong>in 2010</strong> work has been going ahead on another station which will be called Barcelona-La Sagrera or <strong>Sagrera TAV. </strong>The plan is for this new station to become the biggest <strong>rail infrastructure in Catalonia</strong>. This will cover an area of <strong>38 hectares </strong>and provide <strong>all kinds of services</strong>: high-speed, suburban, short- and long-distance rail services plus bus and metro. It is planned to enter operation in <strong>2019</strong> and expected to exceed <strong>100 million passengers annually</strong>, 50 million more than Sants has currently, making it Barcelona&#8217;s most important transport hub and one of the <strong>biggest stations in Europe</strong>.</p>
<h3>Historical remains</h3>
<p>It should be mentioned that during the construction work numerous <strong>archaeological remains</strong> have been found that have delayed the work on a number of occasions. In the middle of 2011, for example, the remains of a <strong>wine-growing Roman villa with thermal baths</strong> were discovered near the Pont de Treball Digne bridge, along with Roman-era <strong>mosaics and paintings</strong>. Later <strong>a sepulchre and graves from the Neolithic period</strong> were discovered and transferred to the <strong>Museu d’Història de Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<p>Another curious anecdote involves the discovery in 2012 of <strong>vine trenches, three ceramic jugs and the structures of some wine presses</strong> dating from the first and beginning of the second century.</p>

<p>On a little over 200 hectares of what used to be industrial sites there are now more than <strong>1,500 companies</strong> linked to the media, IT, energy, design and scientific research. Poblenou&#8217;s <strong>industrial land</strong> was the setting for Barcelona&#8217;s industrialisation and these days it is home to a <strong>knowledge cluster</strong>. But the future has not fallen out with the past, and lots of new companies are housed in <strong>old factories</strong> and Modernista-style industrial complexes. So, the old textile mill Ca l’Aranyó is now the Pompeu Fabra University&#8217;s <strong>Communication Campus</strong>, while the fabric warehouse Can Munné today houses the <strong>Bau design school</strong>.</p>
<h3>Change in design</h3>
<p>Model restorations like <strong>Palo Alto</strong>, an old industrial site that currently houses the studios of artists and creators, such as the designer <strong>Javier Mariscal</strong>, live side by side with the most contemporary architecture. Examples of this are the <strong>Torre Agbar</strong>, designed by the architect Jean Nouvel, and the <strong>Barcelona Growth Centre </strong>building, by the architect Enric Ruiz Geli, a cube with four different faces that has received the highest awards for energy efficiency, sustainability and design.</p>
<p>But restored or new-build, the buildings of 22@ have become <strong>city icons</strong> and turned an industrial neighbourhood into a <strong>laboratory for constant innovation</strong>. Tradition serves progress and the old factories have been redesigned to achieve greater sustainability. Poblenou is living through a new golden age of industry, the age of knowledge.</p>

<p>If we go to the privileged area of the upper classes in Les Corts, climbing up to Pedralbes, in the middle of <strong>Avinguda Diagonal</strong> we find the area known as Zona Universitària, so named because the <strong>biggest university campus</strong> in the city is located here. In this area, amid office blocks, hotels and faculty buildings, are two of the <strong>most iconic of Barcelona&#8217;s parks</strong> which really deserve a look.</p>
<h3>Historical gardens</h3>
<p>Inside the <strong>Pedralbes gardens</strong> is the so-called <strong>Palau Reial</strong> <strong>de Pedralbes</strong>,a 17th century <em>masia, </em>or mansion. Originally, this plot of land was part of the enormous <strong>Güell family</strong> estate, and today, in addition to this &#8220;palace&#8221;, there is also a historically very important garden Due to their proximity to the university facilities, these gardens are particularly the haunt of students.</p>
<p>Since last year, the inside of the palace has been used as a venue for the <strong>Festival de Música Jardins de Pedralbes</strong>, one of the most important in the city.</p>
<p>Another emblematic green area in Zona Universitària is Parc de Cervantes, designed by Lluís Ruidor i Carol in the 1960s, an area which contains more than <strong>10,000 rose bushes</strong>, including <strong>220 different varieties</strong>, and wide paths to stroll down or run along, or places simply to sit in and enjoy the peace and quiet.</p>

<p>Situated in <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong> and making the most of the enormous space afforded by the mountain, the facilities that make up the Anella Olímpica, or Olympic Ring, were created or remodelled from existing ones for the <strong>Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992</strong>.</p>
<p>These include the <strong>Palau Sant Jordi</strong> and the <strong>Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys</strong>, designed by the architect Lluís Abellán Aynès. Today they are used to hold concerts and major cultural and sports events.</p>
<h3>Tall facilities</h3>
<p>Another outstanding feature of the Olympic Ring is the <strong>Telecommunications Tower</strong> built by the Valencia architect Santiago Calatrava. This 136 m high tower with a leaning trunk in the image of a sportsperson is covered with a mosaic, a clear tribute to the architect Antoni Gaudí.</p>
<p>The <strong>Piscines Bernat Picornell</strong>, built by Antoni Lozoya and Antoni Ricard, also form part of the ring and now these swimming pools are used daily by Barcelona people who want to enjoy them. This shows the importance of the Olympic Ring, both in terms of its architectural value and the everyday use it offers city residents.</p>

<p>At 512 m above sea level, Tibidabo is the highest point in the <strong>Collserola range</strong>. Today it is one of the places in the city&#8217;s <strong>historical memory</strong> but it was not until the end of the 19th century that people of Barcelona discovered this mountain next to the city that opened the way to the <strong>green lung</strong> that is Collserola. Until then it had been a bandit&#8217;s lair and pasture for goats.</p>
<p>Plans to develop Avinguda del Tibidabo, with <strong>mansions and stately homes</strong>, also included building an amusement park and a church. So, in 1912, when the park was already up and running, the <strong>Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor</strong> was built, a Neo-Gothic style church reminiscent of the Sacré Coeur in Montmartre, Paris. The upper part of the church is 575 m above sea level and offers some of the <strong>best views</strong> of anywhere in Barcelona. On a clear day it is possible to see the peaks on the island of Mallorca.</p>
<h3>Close to the sky</h3>
<p>Such a high point proved ideal for building an <strong>astronomic observatory</strong>, <strong>the Observatori Fabra</strong> ,which is the fourth oldest in the world and still working. In the summer months, so you can feel a bit closer to the sky, the observatory organises <strong>thematic stargazing suppers</strong>.</p>
<p>Another unmissable part of Tibidabo is the <strong>amusement park</strong>, one of the oldest in Europe and still going strong. It was built at the start of the 20th century and immediately became one of the favourite leisure haunts of Barcelona people. The house of mirrors, the unique views of the city from Talaia, L&#8217;Avió the plane from 1928, and the <strong>fairground machine museum</strong>, offer fun for young and old alike and form part of the city&#8217;s memory.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Gràcia spirit</h3>
<p>Vila de Gràcia is one of the most charismatic neighbourhoods in the city. It still preserves the small, narrow streets of a <strong>rural community</strong>, built round the fast-flowing <strong>streams</strong> that used to pass through it, while its inhabitants proclaim they are proud of being part of Gràcia and of their Gràcia spirit, revived every summer at one of Barcelona&#8217;s most popular <strong>festivals</strong>. Vila de Gràcia is a pleasure to walk round and admire. Highly creative shops can be found on every street, while <strong>terrace culture</strong> has taken root in <strong>every square</strong>, of which there are many. Any time of day or night is good to pause, sit at one of these terraces and watch life pass by in Gràcia.</p>
<h3>Past and present</h3>
<p>Until the 17th century, this neighbourhood was nothing more than a few, <strong>isolated farmhouses</strong>, three convents and the odd villa that the wealthy built as summer houses. But with the dawn of the 19th century came <strong>industrialisation</strong> and Gràcia became important, as it had land that was available for factories to be built on. That was when Gràcia demanded its <strong>independence</strong>, which it achieved three times: in 1821, 1828 and 1849. Vila de Gràcia was finally swallowed up by Barcelona in 1897 but before this a major road had been built that would link the centre of Barcelona with this rapidly expanding town: <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, which made use of the old road that joined the two urban centres.</p>
<p>But industrialisation was not the only thing going on in Vila de Gràcia. For more than two centuries, the <strong>Gypsy community</strong> that had settled round <strong>Plaça del Raspall </strong>had been handling the livestock. A wealthy Gypsy community who, like the Gràcia locals, organised their life round its streets and squares. A cradle that mixed <strong>flamenco rhythms</strong> with Cuban sounds and salsa, brought here by immigrants from the Americas. The result: <strong>Catalan rumba</strong>, a typically Gràcia style of music.</p>
<h3>From square to square</h3>
<p>Gràcia has many faces. <strong>Modernista</strong> Gràcia, which saw the first buildings built by the architect Antoni Gaudí, such as <strong>Casa Vicenç</strong>, on the edge of <strong>Plaça Lesseps</strong>; the Gràcia of iconic squares, such as <strong>Plaça de la Virreina</strong>, <strong>Plaça del Diamant</strong>, which Mercè Rodoreda turned into a novel, <strong>Plaça del Sol</strong>, with its multiculturalism, and <strong>Plaça de la Revolució</strong>, republican and liberal; the Gypsy Gràcia of Catalan rumba and the Gràcia of <strong>independent theatres</strong>, such as the Lliure; the Gràcia capable of mixing local residents with the most Bohemian modernity of the <strong>artists</strong> who set up their workshops there. Fun is strolling round Gràcia, exploring a world of <strong>curious shops</strong>, full of new crafts, old and modern designs, amusing yourself in stately homes, enjoying fresh air in the squares or watching <strong>art house films</strong>. Day or night. There is always something going on in Gràcia.</p>

<p>The Barcelona of wealthy businessmen at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th unfolds in Eixample&#8217;s famous Quadrat d’Or, the Golden Square with its <strong>gems of Modernista architecture</strong>. Bordered by Carrer Aribau and Passeig de Sant Joan, by Avinguda Diagonal at the top and Plaça de Catalunya at the bottom, its main artery is the famous <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, an avenue of leisure for the well off at the start of the 20th century.</p>
<h3>A time for the bourgeoisie</h3>
<p>The demolition of the walls that were suffocating the old Barcelona in 1863, marked the beginning of its expansion and the new Eixample district, designed by the town planner Ildefons Cerdà. Wealthy families moved to this new neighbourhood, giving rise to an <strong>almost fantastical landscape</strong>, as you can see by taking a walk round its streets.</p>
<p>The Quadrat d’Or takes us back to that time when bourgeois families competed to have the most luxurious and extravagant house, and the most renowned architects of the day, such as <strong>Antoni Gaudí, Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong> competed to build it. This competition gave rise to marvels in the form of Modernista buildings with a refined style and impressive facades, not holding back with ceramics and other materials like wrought iron, wood and glass. Every facade has multicoloured stained glass, with flowers and intricate patterns, large windows in organic shapes, and majestic doors. A real spectacle for the eye and the memory, and a legacy of luxury and Modernisme.</p>

<p>When in 1898 the Spanish monarch lost the <strong>Cuban War </strong>and the former colony seized independence, many Catalans who had gone to the Americas came home and built houses that reflected the fortunes they had made across the sea. Some of these entrepreneurs chose to take up residence in the hitherto unpopulated land in the <strong>Sant Andreu district. </strong>It did not take long for the area to get the name Els Indians. Some houses are preserved from that time, among which the most notable is probably the one known as <strong>Torre Rosa</strong>, from 1920, now a cocktail bar.</p>
<h3>The Eucharistic Congress</h3>
<p>In 1952, in a post-war time when society was impoverished and immigration was increasing, the 35th <strong>International Eucharistic Congress </strong>was held in Barcelona, bringing together a large number of religious leaders from around the world. One of the results of this event was the decision to build various estates for the families of the workers, among which the El Congrés neighbourhood was the most important.</p>
<p>The Congrés Eucharístic Housing Trust bought 16.3 hectares of the old <strong>Can Ros</strong> estate belonging to the Ros and Ramis families, where it planned the new neighbourhood under a housing model boasting a generous area that offered two facades to ensure ventilation and which included green areas. A short time afterwards, this zone became annexed to the neighbouring area of Els Indians, making it the neighbourhood of contrasts it is today.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The town centre</h3>
<p>The renovated and modernise.<strong>Plaça d’Orfila was, for nearly a thousand years, the <strong>main square </strong>for the then independent town of Sant Andreu de Palomar, right up until this municipality was annexed to the city of Barcelona in 1897. Up to that point it had been known as <strong>Plaça de la Constitució </strong>or Plaça de l<strong>&#8216;</strong>Església, but joining the city meant a name change. In 1907 it was rechristened with its current name, in honour of the <strong>Menorcan doctor </strong>Josep Orfila i Rotger.</p>
<p>As the old centre of the town, the square houses the old town hall, now the <strong>district offices</strong>, and is presided over by the <strong>parish church of Sant Andreu de Palomar</strong>, a Neoclassical building begun in 1850 and finished in 1904. It sits on the site of an older, Gothic and Baroque temple, where previously there had been a 10th century Romanesque church.</p>
<h3>A square with memories</h3>
<p>Right at the end of the <strong>10th century </strong>the square became the scene of events that went down in the history books -it was sacked by the Muslims, led by the fearsome Almansor. It also had an important role to play in 1640, when it was the meeting point for Els Segadors (the Reapers) who revolted on May 22, taking as their symbol the <strong>Sant Crist dels Segadors </strong>from a chapel in the Sant Andreu church. The result of the revolution was the so-called <strong>Corpus de Sang </strong>(Corpus Christi of Blood), which signified the beginning of the G<strong>uerra dels Segadors </strong>-the Reapers&#8217; War.</p>
<p>Today, ready for the 21st century but without losing the charm of a <strong>town square</strong>, Plaça d’Orfila is the best place to get to know the history of Sant Andreu de Palomar and set off on a walk around the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The district used to be a <strong>rural area</strong> with <em>masies</em>, farmhouses, dotted here and there. There used to be one on the slopes of Turó de la Peira, bordering on Horta, known as <strong>Can Peguera</strong>, that made glue with the resin from the <strong>many pine trees</strong> that grew on its land.</p>
<p>Urban development only reached the area at the start of the 20th century, first in the form of some Modernista residences for wealthy families, of which the odd one still survives, and then the more <strong>humble dwellings</strong>.</p>
<p>In 1929, with the intention of <strong>housing the workers</strong> arriving in Barcelona to work on the International Exposition and build the metro, the Municipal Housing Board bought the old farmhouse land, which belonged to the Marquis of Castellbell&#8217;s estate, and drew up plans to build four blocks of <strong>houses</strong> there.</p>
<p>The terraced dwellings, with a little garden at the front and simple roofs, were named after the governor, although they were soon dubbed the <strong>cheap houses</strong> of Ramon Albó.</p>
<h3>Workers&#8217; houses</h3>
<p>The cheap houses were finished in 1931 and formed a <strong>series of blocks</strong> with 534 houses in all. A further 116 were built in 1947 and in 1949 the first <strong>blocks of flats</strong> were raised, one of them on the site left by the demolition of the old Can Peguera farmhouse.</p>
<p>At that time the Municipal Housing Board also built similar houses for workers&#8217; families in districts such as Sants-Montjuïc and Sant Andreu, but as the years passed these were replaced by blocks of multi-storey flats. Can Peguera, on the other hand, has survived as a <strong>testimony to the past</strong>, maintaining its unique, working-class character.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps was a <strong>French engineer and diplomat</strong>, famous for having directed the building of the Suez and Panama canals. He served as the <strong>French consul</strong> in Barcelona between 1842 and 1848, and during that time he lived in Gràcia, in the square named after him. During the <strong>shelling of Barcelona</strong> ordered by General Espartero on 3 December 1842, Lesseps intervened directly on behalf of the city, and that earned him Barcelona&#8217;s recognition.</p>
<h3>Everyone&#8217;s square</h3>
<p>In 2005 work began on remodelling the square, to facilitate the flow of traffic without being detrimental to the <strong>life of the neighbourhood</strong>. After lots of negotiations, plans were agreed that met a good number of both the goals set and the residents&#8217; requests, which included leaving the <strong>facades of adjacent buildings</strong> visible, equipping the square with <strong>passable spaces</strong> for pedestrians and softening the acoustic impact of traffic.</p>
<p>Today Plaça de Lesseps has urban furniture that allows it to be used by people who live in the area, as well as <strong>sculptures</strong> (the beam crossing the square, which represents the Suez Canal, stands out), <strong>trees</strong> and <strong>gardens</strong>. Notable buildings include the Jaume Fuster Library and the Church of the Josepets, the oldest building in the square.</p>

<p>The square has had four official names: Plaça d’Orient, de la Constitució, de Rius i Taulet and, finally, de la Vila de Gràcia. <strong>Historical events</strong> have taken place here, like the Conscripts&#8217; Revolt in 1870 when, according to tradition, local people rebelled and refused to enrol their sons in the army. The <strong>bell</strong> in what was then Plaça d’Orient began to ring in a call to resist that became a symbol. It did not stop for six days, despite being battered by the army&#8217;s cannons. Legend has it that a local woman was able to ring the bell to warn the people that the army was coming by means of a rope that reached her roof.</p>
<h3>The town hall and the bell tower</h3>
<p>The legendary <strong>bell tower</strong> was built by <strong>Antoni Rovira i Trias</strong> between 1862 and 1864. It is a 33-metre-high <strong>octagonal tower</strong> with a four-sided clock and a fountain at its base.</p>
<p>The building that housed the town hall, and which is now home to the district council offices, was built by Francesc Berenguer in <strong>1904</strong>, and it stands out because of its sky blue facade. A wrought-iron <strong>Gr</strong><strong>àcia coat of arms</strong> can be seen on it, as well as decorative features on the windows and balconies, real works of art also made out of wrought iron.</p>

<p>Santa Eulàlia de Vilapicina was an <strong>old hamlet</strong> dating from the 10th or 11th century that later belonged to the independent municipality of Sant Andreu, before it was annexed by Barcelona at the end of the 19th century.Today it is part of the Nou Barris district and, despite the passage of time, it still preserves vestiges of that <strong>past as a rural hamlet</strong> built around a church that is still standing today. The old street <strong>Carrer</strong><strong> de </strong><strong>Pere d&#8217;Artés</strong> runs through this thousand-year-old set of buildings, which still survive after so many years.In the middle of them is the <strong>Church of Santa Eulàlia de Vilapicina</strong>, which was built on the remains of an earlier Romanesque church in 1782, preserving its chapel and some of its outer walls.</p>
<h3>Farmhouses with history</h3>
<p>The old Vilapicina road that used to link Sant Andreu with Horta was also respected and a bridge was built to link Vilapicina with <strong>Can Basté</strong>,one of the other buildings that can still be seen in this old centre today. The 17th-century farmhouse, which belonged to some tenant farmers, was renovated several times in the course of its history, until it became the property of the City Council in 1980 and was turned into the Can Basté <strong>civic centre</strong>. Another civic centre can be found at <strong>Torre Llobeta</strong>. This 15th-century mansion is one of the most remarkable farms on the Barcelona plain. The historical centre of Vilapicina also includes the <strong>Ca n’Artés farmhouse</strong>,which was a travellers&#8217; inn during the 14th and 15th centuries, owned by the monk and art enthusiast Pere d’Artés.Today the house is in a perilous state but it still preserves some <strong>original medieval features</strong>, such as the door with a round arch in the middle of the facade and one of the windows with a pointed arch.</p>
<p>A stroll through this piece of history in the present-day district of Nou Barris, contemplating the <strong>rural remains</strong> of places that no longer exist, encourages you to travel back to a distant past that still survives today.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A square with the name of a jewel</h3>
<p>Gràcia is a neighbourhood filled with tiny streets and squares, and <strong>Plaça del Diamant</strong> is one of its oldest and most emblematic ones. Located in what was formerly known as the<strong> jewellers neighbourhood</strong>, Plaça del Diamant owes its name to the Gràcia town councillor, <strong>Josep Rosell i Imbert</strong>, who engaged in the trade of precious stones. When he designed this plot in 1850, he came up with the idea of giving the streets and squares that still exist the <strong>names of precious stones</strong>: Carrer de la Perla (Pearl), Or (Gold) and Topaci (Topaz).</p>
<h3>Literature and memory</h3>
<p>Engraved in the popular memory by the <strong>famous novel</strong> <em>La plaça del Diamant</em> by <strong>Mercè Rodoreda</strong>, and its subsequent adaptation as a film by <strong>Francesc Betriu</strong> in 1980, in this <strong>delightful nook </strong>in the city one can still sit on a bench and listen to the birds singing and the children playing in the square. As a tribute to the novel, a sculpture of <strong><em>La Colometa</em> </strong>by the artist<strong> Xavier Medina-Campeny</strong> was installed in 1984, depicting the main character with her doves.</p>
<p>The symbology of the square took an unexpected turn in 1992, when the <strong>air-raid shelter</strong> beneath the square was discovered during the execution of road works. Built twelve metres below ground level by the residents of the neighbourhood during the <strong>Spanish Civil War</strong>, it gave shelter to more than two hundred people during the many air-raid attacks launched on the <strong>industrial district of Gràcia </strong>of that time, with its many factories that were the main target of the attacking aircraft. This shelter was one of the more than 90 in the neighbourhood, and it is one of the largest of the 1,300 that were built in Barcelona, one of the first cities bombarded systematically from the air in a war. Today, with the objective of recovering the area&#8217;s historical memory, the History Workshop of Gràcia arranges <strong>guided tours</strong> to explore the site and it is well worth visiting the shelter and seeing its tunnels which saved the lives of so many people.</p>

<p>Passeig de Sant Joan is located in <strong>Dreta de l&#8217;Eixample</strong>, the right side, starting at Travessera de Gràcia and going down to the impressive <strong>Arc de Triomf</strong> and Parc de la<strong> Ciutadella</strong>. Although it is not as well-known as Passeig de Gràcia, Passeig Sant Joan has its own charm, and some of the least-known Modernista buildings , such as Casa Macaya, by the architect Puig i Cadafalch, which was even put forward as a home for CaixaForum.</p>
<p> The history of this avenue dates back to the <strong>end of the 19th century</strong>, when the Eixample started to be built. In fact, it is named after the former avenue that bordered the esplanade of Ciutadella, which disappeared after the old military citadel was demolished.</p>
<h3>The pleasure of walking</h3>
<p>To walk &amp; up to Gràcia or down this peaceful avenue, observing the <strong>classic buildings of the Eixample</strong> and some of the treasures of Modernisme, is a pleasure. To stop in the <strong>gardens and observe the sculptures</strong>, such as the one of the priest Jacint Verdaguer, and to enjoy the <strong>traditional stores</strong> and fountains, such as the Font d&#8217;Hèrcules, <strong>the oldest monumental</strong> fountain in the city, is a real experience for learning about a part of old Barcelona at the beginning of the 20th century. The Arc de Triomf appears as the final reward, letting you through to Parc de la Ciutadella and so end a <strong>wonderful walk</strong>.</p>

<p>Horta&#8217;s <strong>old quarter</strong>, in the part below the Ronda de Dalt ring road, is where the <strong>Cor d’Horta shopping hub</strong> and market can be found. Here there are some well-known streets which maintain their village-like feel with small houses and gardens. Carrer de la Galla, Carrer del Rajoler and Carrer de Sanpere i Miquel, for example, as well as others. The epicentre of all these streets is <strong>Plaça d’Eivissa</strong>. This square, recently expanded for the enjoyment of local residents, is where much of the neighbourhood&#8217;s life goes on, a <strong>delightful spot</strong> with bars, terraces, places to sit down and play areas for the little ones.</p>
<p>Very close to this area is <strong>Can Mariner</strong>, an imposing 17th-century house, which today is a <strong>library specialising in theatre</strong>, that reinforces the rural feel of this area.</p>
<p>If you delve into the little streets, you will find <strong>Plaça de Sant<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">a</span></strong><strong>es</strong><strong> Creus</strong>, which was previously Horta&#8217;s main square, and which still has the building that housed the <strong>district town hall</strong>. Today various municipal services are based there.</p>
<h3>Surprising treasures</h3>
<p>Horta also has another hidden treasure: its own <strong><em>eixample</em></strong> (extension), which grew up at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, and where you can find several examples of <strong>Modernista architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>The streets making up the <strong>shopping centre</strong> of this area deserve a special mention. Carrer de Lisboa, Carrer del Tajo, Baixada de la Plana and Carrer de Dante make up an enchanting group of shops offering good <strong>quality produce</strong> at reasonable prices. A morning stroll through these streets, either shopping or simply looking, can be a very pleasant <strong>journey back in time</strong>.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Much more than a neighbourhood</h3>
<p>If you had to describe Sant Andreu&#8217;s character in two words, they would be <strong>tradition and struggle</strong>. And in the middle, <strong>the residents</strong>. Sant Andreu has residents, but the century-old associations, local shops, an active social life, and people greeting each other on the streets are what make it a real neighbourhood. It still has traces of the village it used to be and which is still very much alive in <strong>Plaça Orfila</strong> and the historical centre, full of intimate little side streets and century-old shops, like those you can find on Carrer <strong>Gran de Sant Andreu</strong>.<br />
But Sant Andreu conceals a lot more treasures. Some, even though you cannot see them, are documented and date back to <strong>Roman times</strong>. Like the remains of the aqueduct that served the Rec Comtal, the large canal that used to carry water across Barcelona. Others, which you can see, such as the <strong>Can Carasses</strong> <em>masia </em>or farmhouse, today the Escola Ignasi Iglésias school, speak of Sant Andreu&#8217;s agricultural past when it was tasked with supplying Barcelona, in the 17th century.</p>
<p>And yet more, treasures that describe the great industrial past of the 18th century, like the <strong>Fabra i Coats spinning mill</strong> that has now been reclaimed, after a long struggle by local residents, providing 30,000 square metres for public use including the Fabra i Coats-Creation, the Centre Cultural Can Fabra, the local library Biblioteca Ignasi Iglésias, the neighbourhood centre Casal de Barri de Sant Andreu, the Espai social i cultural Josep Bota and Plaça de Can Fabra. <strong>Modernisme</strong> also left its mark in Sant Andreu, with properties such as Can Guardiola, today providing office space for non-profit associations, and Can Vidal, as did <strong>rationalism</strong>, with a gem of contemporary architecture, Casa Bloc, commissioned by Catalonia&#8217;s republican government in 1932 and who invited architects from all round the world to study the structure.</p>
<h3>Festivals and traditions</h3>
<p>Sant Andreu is a neighbourhood that has held on to its traditions and turned its festivals into unmissable events for everyone. It is the first Barcelona neighbourhood to hold the annual <strong>Tres Tombs festival</strong>, with its blessing of pets and domestic animals. For this a <strong>procession</strong> sets off from Plaça Orfila with ox-drawn <strong>carts</strong> and horse-drawn <strong>carriages</strong>, whose occupants throw tonnes of sweets to the watching public.</p>
<p>And from sweets to blunderbusses, <em>trabucs </em>in Catalan, because there is another kind of procession, a <em>cercavila</em>, that fills Sant Andreu&#8217;s residents with pride. And that is the <strong>Esclat Andreuenc</strong>, where a group of <strong><em>trabucaires</em></strong>wake up the neighbourhood by firing off salvoes with their guns. Sant Andreu is the past, but it is also the <strong>present</strong> and the <strong>future</strong> that the associations and proud local residents are committed to maintaining.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A new look</h3>
<p>The neighbourhood of El Clot is a place for a leisurely stroll, with your hands in your pockets and your <strong>eyes peeled</strong>. The impressive Torre Agbar, 144 m of steel, glass, light and colour, makes you lift your gaze skywards to see where it ends. But now this tower, which altered Barcelona&#8217;s skyline, has a companion that is set to become a global benchmark for design, namely <strong>Disseny Hub Barcelona</strong>, the work of the MBM team of architects: Josep Martorell, Oriol Bohigas and David Mackay. The building is a cantilevered parallelepiped, the same width as the street, and it has become a reference for contemporary architecture. It has the <strong>highest sustainability rating</strong> a building can get and houses a museum, the <strong>Museu del Disseny</strong> de Barcelona, with a collection of over 70,000 items.</p>
<p>Yet in El Clot there is also time for a <strong>relaxing walk</strong> round the parks and other places with more charm. Despite the train lines and the main thoroughfares of Avinguda de la <strong>Meridiana</strong> and <strong>Gran Via</strong>, there are some spots worth a visit that take you back to a charming rural and industrial past. The <strong>Farinera del Clot</strong>, one of the biggest flour mills in Catalonia, is in this neighbourhood. Now this Modernista-style former industrial site is an ICT-driven <strong>cultural centre</strong>.</p>
<h3>Places to discover</h3>
<p>El Clot still has lots of alleyways, <strong>little streets</strong> running between two broader ones, that speak of a past of gardens and vegetable patches. <strong>Passatge de Robacols</strong>, (cabbage stealer passage) for example, where a row of little white houses seem to be caught in a time warp, or the <strong>Torre del Fang</strong> (mud tower), an old farmhouse that has been preserved. In the heart of the neighbourhood, <strong>Plaça del Mercat</strong> still displays the same commercial vitality that made the market, a pretty Modernista construction, the place to go for fruit and vegetables in Barcelona. Not far away, the <strong>Caixa de Pensions i Mont de Pietat</strong> building, still operating, makes us look up to its semicircular dome, and then it is time to look for the frogs hiding under an umbrella in a <strong>Modernista mosaic</strong> of the old J. Budesca umbrella shop. Scraps of the old city are still kept alive at the popular <strong>Mercat dels Encants</strong>, a Fira de Bellcaire or flea market where you can find virtually everything, in the style of the French Marché aux Puces.</p>
<p><strong>Parc del Clot</strong> is the place to rest and enjoy nature in this neighbourhood. A big green space on the site of the train company Renfe&#8217;s old mechanical workshops that has kept the <strong>factory chimney stack</strong> and the old facade, now turned into <strong>an aqueduct with a waterfall</strong>.</p>

<p>At the start of the 20th century, Poblenou was known as the &#8220;Catalan Manchester&#8221; and now it could become the &#8220;Silicon Valley of Barcelona&#8221;. The workers are changing but its <strong>hardworking</strong> character remains.</p>
<p>Poblenou, a neighbourhood on the Sant Martí <strong>seaboard</strong>, has seen how the physiognomy of its streets has changed without losing their essence. Cheap, available land close to Barcelona, and water in abundance, led to factories being built and the growth of a very powerful <strong>industrial district</strong>. There were factories of every kind: textile mills such as Ca l’Aranyó (today the home of <strong>Pompeu Fabra University</strong>), and Can Felipa (now a civic centre), engineering plants like Can Girona (of which the chimney has been preserved), flour mills, tanneries, chocolate factories, and liqueur distilleries. These <strong>factories</strong> and their <strong>chimneys</strong>, over 30 of which are still dotted round the neighbourhood, competed for space with the houses hurriedly built for the workers and even the shantytown that grew up on the beach, round <strong>Somorrostro</strong>, where the great flamenco <em>bailaora</em> Carmen Amaya was born. You can easily trace the historical footprints that have been left by walking round the old, still narrow streets, while the more adventurous can take a tour of the <strong>cemetery</strong>, the first in the city, where it is possible to see the old Neoclassical and Modernista mausoleums.</p>
<h3>A new character for new times</h3>
<p>The <strong>1992 Barcelona Olympics</strong> opened the city up to the sea and gave the whole area a new character. The traditional industries gradually disappeared and the neighbourhood was transformed. It still retains its working-class character but what it produces has changed a lot. In the same factory buildings, examples of early 20th century <strong>industrial architecture</strong>, overalls have been replaced by sneakers in a landscape of <strong>technology companies, design and universities</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rambla del Poblenou</strong>, where Carmen Amaya danced her first steps and anarchists fought for better wages, where you can find century-old shops and other establishments, today has an air of <strong>calm and tradition</strong> without forgetting those roots. <strong>Tío Che</strong> makes sure of that. A cafe that used to sell the popular tiger-nut drink <strong><em>orxata</em></strong>to exhausted workers as they came out of the factories now sells it to young creators in their sandals and jeans, who have turned the Catalan Manchester into the Silicon Valley of Barcelona.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Roman and medieval essence</h3>
<p>Entering the Gothic Quarter is to make for Barcelona&#8217;s origins, the place where two thousand years ago the Romans founded <strong>Bàrcino</strong>. Today, we can follow the traces of that Roman city thanks to preserved fragments of the walls that encompass a perimeter which still marks the typical layout of a Roman town. The <em>cardo</em>, located along today&#8217;s Carrer Llibreteria, the <em>decumanus</em> along Carrer Ciutat and the Forum, where Plaça Sant Jaume is today, in the centre. Very close to this square, going up Carrer Paradís to the doorway of the ramblers&#8217; club, the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya, you can find a millstone that signals the highest point of <strong>Mont Tàber</strong>, a hill rising 16 m above sea level and, inside, hidden in the patio of this Gothic building, four columns are preserved from the <strong>Roman temple</strong> that stood at this point.</p>
<p>Roman Bàrcino was transformed into Medieval Barcelona, and at the hand of the counts and kings it became one of the most splendid cities in Christian Europe. The Jews who settled in Barcelona clustered around <strong>El Call</strong>, a network of narrow, chaotic streets with a multitude of houses, among which we can still find vestiges of that time, like the <strong>main synagogue</strong>, one of the oldest in Europe and which can be recognised by the hole on the right-hand side of the lintel.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages brought with them commerce, the arts and the professions, the appearance of the sober Romanesque style in buildings like the <strong>Capella de Santa Llúcia</strong>, a chapel integrated into the Barcelona&#8217;s cathedral, and the Gothic explosion, with the cathedral being the prime example, as well as other numerous unique buildings. <strong>Plaça Sant Jaume</strong> became the home of the city council and since then it has been the seat of Barcelona&#8217;s main political institutions, the City Council and the Catalan Government, in the two imposing Gothic buildings that face each other across the square.</p>
<h3>Places with history</h3>
<p>The narrow streets and little squares of this neighbourhood invite you to wander around and let yourself be surprised by its charm and always lively atmosphere. There are many curious little corners, like <strong>Plaça Traginers</strong>, under one of the towers on the Roman walls; <strong>Plaça Sant Just</strong>, with the oldest medieval fountain in the city and an imposing Gothic church; and the Baroque <strong>Plaça Sant Felip Neri</strong>, with a central fountain that fills it with freshness.</p>
<p>Painters like Picasso, Casas, Novell and Russinyol have strolled through the Gothic Quarter looking for inspiration before entering the <strong>Quatre Gats cafe</strong>, on Carrer Montsió. Gaudí also walked here as he took his daily saunter to the church of Sant Felip Neri, as did the architect Domènech i Montaner on his way to find inspiration for the Palau de la Música. Thousands of visitors walk through the Barri Gòtic everyday, following in the footsteps of history.</p>

<p>A defiant blue building, the triangular <strong>Edifici Fòrum</strong>, welcomes you to a newly built neighbourhood that has given <strong>light and visibility</strong> to one of the most deserted and ignored parts of the city: the Fòrum, a neighbourhood developed around the first Universal Forum of Cultures in 2004.</p>
<p>In this <strong>new</strong> Sant Martí <strong>neighbourhood</strong>, <strong>leisure and culture</strong> have swallowed up formerly industrial land. Abandoned sites were turned into <strong>Parc del Fòrum</strong>, a complex that holds the city&#8217;s biggest events: <strong>mega music festivals</strong> such as Primavera Sound, the La Mercè festival concerts and the spectacular &#8220;Feria de Abril&#8221;. This is the ideal setting for these <strong>crowdpullers</strong>.</p>
<p>Parc del Fòrum includes the Edifici Fòrum, a spectacular triangular building, 25 m high, that houses the <strong>Museu Blau</strong>, Barcelona&#8217;s new national natural sciences museum; the <strong>Esplanade</strong>, the second biggest square in the world covering 84,000 square metres; the <strong>Parc dels Auditoris</strong>, a large outdoor space that combines two halls linked by a passageway; and the <strong>Zona de Banys</strong>, a bathing area with an unusual set of sea-water swimming pools. The park is an oasis of leisure activities and festivals, firmly committed to the environment and sustainability, with its huge 1,700 m <sup>2</sup> <strong>solar-panel</strong>.</p>
<h3>Future potential</h3>
<p>The Fòrum is on the edge of the <strong>Diagonal Mar</strong> neighbourhood and is one of the new areas of Barcelona with the most potential. The transformation from a rundown past to a highly <strong>skilled and technological</strong> future has completely revived the whole area. Siting Diagonal Mar, a <strong>huge shopping centre</strong>, there and opening it up to the sea by reclaiming the <strong>urban beaches</strong> and <strong>Parc Diagonal Mar</strong>, the work of architects Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue and consisting of a residential complex with skyscrapers, a large <strong>garden with a lake </strong>and a sports area, have made this part of the city the ideal place to see the Barcelona of the future: <strong>modern and sustainable</strong>, without forgetting its past.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The athletes’ neighbourhood</h3>
<p>The <strong>1992 Barcelona Olympic Games</strong> were responsible for various parts of the city being completely redeveloped. For example, the Olympic village, Vila Olímpica, was built in the middle of an <strong>industrial district</strong>, an old shantytown and a beach not worthy of the name. This <strong>newly constructed</strong> neighbourhood, with some truly iconic buildings, breathed new life into a rundown area. The <strong>design</strong>, produced by a team of architects consisting of Josep Martorell, Oriol Bohigas, David Mackay and Albert Puigdomènech, followed the grid model of the Eixample district&#8217;s housing islands.</p>
<p>Vila Olímpica was the <strong>official residence</strong> of the Barcelona &#8217;92 <strong>athletes</strong> but they gave way to families who gradually moved into the neighbourhood, which established itself as a <strong>benchmark for quality and tranquility</strong> in Barcelona. Wide roads, such as Avinguda Icària and Avinguda Bogatell, are bright and open, and invite people to take a stroll along them. The Olympic port, Port Olímpic, and Nova Icària have opened up the <strong>seafront</strong>. They have made Barcelona turn back towards the sea and enjoy it again, and by doing so, they have become one of the city&#8217;s top leisure spots.</p>
<h3>Facing the sea</h3>
<p>The <strong>twinned towers</strong>, Torre Mapfre and Hotel Arts, both over 154 m high, have changed the city&#8217;s skyline with their metal structures and welcome visitors to the new waterfront. Architect <strong>Frank Gehry&#8217;s</strong> <strong>Peix d’Or</strong> , an impressive bronze sculpture of a fish that changes colour with the time of day, is a reminder of the neighbourhood&#8217;s maritime past. Now lots of <strong>bars, <em>chiringuitos,</em> and restaurants</strong> congregate under its scales and have turned this into one of Barcelona&#8217;s most vibrant leisure areas.</p>
<p>The Vila Olímpica seafront also has a <strong>beach</strong>, <strong>Nova Icària</strong>, a tranquil haven for the people. Having a beach right next to the city, which you can get to by metro or bus, really is worth an Olympic medal.</p>

<p>Situated between the extremes of bustling Sants and the tranquility of Barcelona&#8217;s upper reaches, Les Corts is the <strong>midway point</strong>, combining the peacefulness that characterises the well-off neighbourhoods and the accessibility that still remains in the former workers&#8217; colonies from the beginning of the 20th century, like the <strong>old Colònia Castells</strong>.</p>
<h3>Vestiges of a rural past</h3>
<p>Part of a <strong>previously independent municipality</strong> that was annexed to Barcelona in 1898, the Les Corts neighbourhood still has fragments of personality hidden between the big residential blocks. From its incredibly rural roots, with a more upper-class sector that used to be known as Les Corts Velles, old Les Corts, there are still remains of this past to be found in the <strong>mansions</strong> and <strong>farmhouses</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>squares</strong> of <strong>Can Rosés</strong>, <strong>Comas</strong> and <strong>La Concòrdia</strong>, located along the main streets crossing the area, are the old centre, and the latter preserves the most charm, being home to the Antiga Farmàcia, the 19th century pharmacy, the Boages cake shop, the Fragments Cafè and the little palace from 1897, which is now the <strong>Centre Cívic Can Deu</strong>.</p>

When it was a rural community, the farmers stored the harvest in the church silos, called <strong><em>sagrers</em></strong> because, being on a sacred site, they were protected from war and pillage. The <strong>popular, hard-working</strong> consciousness of the neighbourhood is something that has been maintained over the years.</p>
<p>Industrialisation brought factories to La Sagrera, like <strong>La Pegaso</strong>, which has now been turned into a municipal park, the long-gone <strong>Farinera l’Esperança</strong>, a flour mill, and the <strong>Ivanow</strong> paint factory which, after housing a number of different companies, is now the Nau Ivanow, an art and creation centre.</p>
<p>These are vestiges of an <strong>industrial era</strong> intimately linked to the growth of <strong>Avinguda Meridiana</strong>, the main road through the neighbourhood. 15 Its easily identifiable tall blocks of flats, some more than 15 storeys high, have become an icon of this <strong>entrance</strong> to Barcelona.</p>
<h3>Neighbourhood treasures</h3>
<p>Yet La Sagrera&#8217;s lovely little old quarter, tucked away behind the concrete tower blocks and centred round <strong>Plaça Masadas</strong>, is a peaceful haven that still maintains the tranquility of a family neighbourhood. <strong>Plaça de l’Assemblea de Catalunya</strong> and Parc dels <strong>Jardins d’Elx</strong> offer a green space <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">s</span> open to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>An opportunity to contemplate and enjoy a <strong>historic centre</strong> that has revealed treasures including <strong>Roman remains</strong> unearthed during the excavation work for the new train station, one of the largest in Europe.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Working-class neighbourhood</h3>
<p>As a <strong>multicultural</strong> and <strong>working-class</strong> neighbourhood, Poble-sec maintains a popular character and varied culture, and it is open to all those who want to go and take a look. Its main arteries are <strong>Carrer Blai</strong>, which is like a little &#8220;rambla&#8221; packed with bars and shops in equal measure, and <strong>Plaça del Sortidor</strong>, where a young Joan Manel Serrat used to play and now you can find the neighbourhood civic centre, which has been very active in recent years.</p>
<p>Poble-sec&#8217;s history dates back to the middle of the 19th century, when it was a basically rural area with vegetable plots and the hovels of farm labourers who worked in the shadow of Montjuïc&#8217;s lower slopes. Around 1850 families started to move there, mainly immigrants who could no longer squeeze into Raval, as noted at the time. Regarded as Barcelona&#8217;s first extension (<em>eixample</em>) before the Cerdà Plan was implemented, Poble-sec still retains the chaotic narrow streets that have so much charm.</p>
<p>Its name comes from the large number of <strong>textile mills</strong> that were set up there at the end of the 19th century. They consumed so much water that they left an area that had always had it in abundance dry (<em>sec</em>)</p>
<h3>Multicultural atmosphere</h3>
<p>Aside from this industrial activity, the fact it is behind Avinguda del Paral·lel means Poble-sec has always been linked to the <strong>world of entertainment</strong> as well. And the presence of emblematic theatres such as El Molino, the Apolo, the Condal and the Victòria, with their ample and varied <strong>cultural offering</strong>, has led to new types of <strong>cuisine</strong> appearing in the neighbourhood too.</p>

<p>Plaça d’Espanya is one of the city&#8217;s major squares, connecting the Sants neighbourhood, the Gran Via, Avinguda del Paral·lel and Parc de Montjuïc. Designed by the Modernista architect <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong>,and built during the <strong>1929 International Exposition</strong>, it had already been envisaged in the Cerdà Plan as a point linking Barcelona and the small Baix Llobregat towns.</p>
<p>It is surrounded by iconic buildings and in its centre there is a monumental fountain called the <strong>Font dels Tres Mars</strong>. Designed by Josep Maria Jujol, it symbolises the three seas (<em>mars</em>) that surround the Iberian peninsula. Next to the square stands the old <strong>Arenes</strong> bullring, built by the architect August Font i Carreras and now one of the city&#8217;s best shopping centres. The <strong>Fira de Barcelona</strong>, which hosts major trade fairs and exhibitions, is also here and on the edge of the square there are two Venetian towers that welcome visitors on their arrival at Parc de Montjuïc.</p>
<h3>Focal point</h3>
<p>The continuous movement round the square, which is one of key points in Barcelona&#8217;s road network, is a reflection of the city&#8217;s <strong>animated character</strong>. And the view at night offered by the <strong>Magic Fountain</strong> and the <strong>Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya</strong> is one of the city&#8217;s icons.</p>

<p>The Sarrià neighbourhood still has the small-town air that so enthused the Catalan bourgeoisie in the 19th century: little streets and squares built around the high street, <strong>Carrer Major</strong>, narrow pavements on streets where neighbours greet one another as they pass by. Thanks to the craftsmen and middle classes who built their <strong>summer houses</strong> here, Sarrià became one of the most prosperous parts of Barcelona. The architecture reflects this splendour through the houses, many of them Modernista constructions, that can be found in the, on Passatge Mallofré or in Plaça Sant Vicenç.</p>
<h3>Sweet, poetic walks</h3>
<p>Near <strong>Plaça de Sarrià</strong> is Casa Orlandai , today the district&#8217;s <strong>civic centre</strong> and a Modernista gem, with interior decoration and stained glass windows that make it worth visiting and even a having a coffee in the interior terrace. Taking a stroll round Sarrià would not be the same without stopping to admire the mouth-watering window displays at the <strong>Foix cake shop</strong>, a veritable institution in the neighbourhood. With over 125 years of history behind it, this patisserie has sweetened the life of many Barcelona folk. The writer <strong>J. V. Foix</strong>, the son of its founder, swapped sweets for poems to become one of the leading literary lights of the Catalan arts. Moving from pastries to fried potatoes at <strong>Bar Tomàs</strong>, on Carrer Major, you can try what are considered to be the <strong>best <em>patates braves</em></strong>in the city.</p>
<p><strong>Sarrià</strong> was independent until 1921, when it was annexed by Barcelona. Despite that, it has retained its spirit of independent amid big Barcelona. Strolling round its <strong>squares and streets</strong>, pay attention to the houses and shops: they whisper the history of a small town that remains faithful to its essence.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Sants</strong> and <strong>Hostafrancs</strong> neighbourhoods, like <strong>La Bordeta</strong> next door, every day is a market day, so a morning stroll through their bustling streets is a real joy. They have always kept their <strong>authentic character</strong>, which is reflected in the energy of their residents, always active through the <strong>links between the official bodies</strong> of the three neighbourhoods and various <strong>cultural associations</strong>, such as the Centre Cívic de les Cotxeres de Sants, Can Batlló and the Casinet d’Hostafrancs.</p>
<p>Joined together by a long shopping street originally called <strong>Creu Coberta</strong> and subsequently Carrer de Sants, these neighbourhoods spread their domain through little side streets and squares that are sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. Sants occupies the central part and its <strong>commercial life</strong> revolves round places like Plaça de Bonet i Muixí, the square with the Santa Maria dels Sants parish church, around which the first village in the area grew up. Its <strong>municipal market</strong> is really popular and in the emblematic little streets around it, such as Carrer de Sant Medir and Carrer de Sant Jordi, you can see and buy any item that might come into your head. There is a lot of activity round <strong>Barcelona Sants</strong> too, the city&#8217;s main <strong>railway station</strong>, which makes this one of the best connected neighbourhoods.</p>
<h3>Industrial past</h3>
<p>Hostafrancs developed after Sants in the middle of the 19th century and from the word go industry thrived there, especially the textile industry. This attracted a wave of people to the neighbourhood and gave it the <strong>commercial character</strong> that it maintains today.</p>
<p>Its <strong>daily market</strong> and many shops and businesses offer all kinds of quality products and services. Leaving the main shopping streets behind and exploring the neighbourhood&#8217;s hidden corners, you will find a web of little-known alleyways and low-built houses that evoke a village atmosphere in a city.</p>
<p>Sants and Hostafrancs also share one of the city&#8217;s most surprising green spaces, <strong>Parc de l’Espanya Industrial</strong>. This has transformed the old site of El Vapor Nou, a former cotton mill, into urban gardens with a lake in the middle and a 7 m high metal structure in the shape of a <strong>wild dragon</strong> which, as a slide, delights old and young alike.</p>

The wrought iron market, built at the end of the 19th century and currently undergoing a major renovation, occupies the block bordered by four streets: Comte Borrell, Manso, Comte d’Urgell and Tamarit.

<p>Walking through Sant Pere i Santa Caterina, you find surprises around every corner. Roman remains, a reminder of the <strong>Rec Comtal</strong> irrigation canal, vestiges of the old textile guilds. These medieval neighbourhoods are open history books in the middle of the city. Crossing narrow streets and squares you come to <strong>Plaça de Sant Pere</strong>, where you can see the remains of the old Romanesque Benedictine convent, <strong>Sant Pere de les Puelles</strong>, which was the origin of the neighbourhood. This convent was one of the richest in Barcelona, as the Benedictines took in many of the daughters of the nobility who wanted to take their vows. The other part of the neighbourhood, Santa Caterina, also had religious beginnings, as it grew up around the <strong>Gothic convent</strong> of the Dominican Order. And from a nunnery, to a market. In 1848, a fire affected the convent, which was demolished. Its site became the location of the first covered market in an enclosure within the city: the Santa <strong>Caterina market</strong>, a Neoclassical construction, completely renovated in 2005 by the architect Enric Miralles, who designed the ceramic mosaic roof that has turned it into one of the neighbourhood&#8217;s iconic buildings.</p>
<h3>Yesterday’s names and today’s colours</h3>
<p>In the 18th century, the Santa Caterina and Sant Pere neighbourhoods became two important industrial centres, particularly for textile manufacturing. The street names are the best way to follow in these footsteps: rope makers, carders, blanket weavers, cotton makers, Plaça de la Llana (wool square), <strong>narrow winding streets</strong>, built along the ancient Roman roads where hundreds of factory houses clustered together to house the workers. Population pressure increased, and in 1835, in order to let a little air in, <strong>Carrer Princesa</strong> was opened, the first paved street in the city. But it was not until the 20th century that the whole area was reorganised with the building of <strong>Via Laietana</strong>, a wide avenue that divides the city&#8217;s historical centre into two, with Santa Caterina, Sant Pere and La Ribera on one side and El Gòtic on the other.</p>
<p>Santa Caterina and Sant Pere, two of the neighbourhoods in Ciutat Vella with the most personality, have now come back to life with a multitude of small restaurants, shops and bars, and the area is a mixture of multiculturalism and independent artists that attract visitors. Poets, painters, nobles and even thieves, like the bandit <strong>Joan de Serrallonga</strong>, have lived here. Strolling around here is to live the city&#8217;s history on the streets themselves.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Footprints of the past</h3>
<p>The oldest building still preserved in El Raval is the <strong>Sant Pau del Camp</strong> monastery. It is Romanesque in style and originated in the 10th century when the area was outside Barcelona&#8217;s walls. But it in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhood was full of cultivated fields and convents, it too was protected, by the third city walls. Some important buildings, built in the Gothic style then prevailing in Barcelona, remain from that time. The imposing <strong>Drassanes</strong>, for example, the shipyards that mark the maritime edge of the neighbourhood, and the <strong>old Hospital de la Santa Creu</strong> building, now transformed into the national library, the Biblioteca Nacional de Catalunya, which has an internal courtyard full of orange trees that is open to everyone and invites you in to have a rest.</p>
<p>It was not until the 18th century that urban planning made this another of the city&#8217;s neighbourhoods, and immediately, thanks to the low rents, it became the home of workers and immigrants from outside Barcelona, who often came fleeing hunger in the countryside to work in the ever more active industries in the city. Despite the natural darkness of El Raval, where it seems the sun finds it hard to shine in the middle of the humid narrow streets, Antoni Gaudí also left a colourful impression in the shape of <strong>Palau Güell</strong>, the family home of the businessman Eusebi Güell and the first great work of the Modernista architect, on Carrer Nou de la Rambla.</p>
<h3>Transformation of the neighbourhood</h3>
<p>At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, due to its proximity to the port, this became Barcelona&#8217;s <em>barri xinès</em>, or Chinatown. The centre of working-class riots, it was hit hard by the wars, which did not help El Raval lose the air of a marginal outskirt that hung over it for years. But the good times finally did come to the &#8220;<em>xinès</em>&#8220;: The opening up of the <strong>Rambla del Raval</strong> in the late 20th century, the renovation of many of the houses and iconic buildings, the positioning of more modern museums, like the <strong>Museu d’Art Contemporani</strong> (MACBA) and the <strong>Centre de Cultura Contemporània</strong> (CCCB), the opening of the <strong>Filmoteca de Catalunya</strong> building and, more than anything else, the &#8220;reconquest&#8221; of the streets and squares by the people has transformed El Raval into a neighbourhood that offers a richer and more varied culture, that every day attracts more artists and artisans and where new ideas are always emerging. The streets are the same, but today they seem wider, more full of light and life. The mixed backgrounds of the people and the great cultural life here makes this neighbourhood one of the liveliest in the city, and <em>ravalejant</em> lets you discover the many worlds in one which is El Raval.</p>

<p>Barceloneta, Ciutat Vella&#8217;s <strong>marine neighbourhood</strong>, has always been linked to the sea. Its history goes back to the 18th century, when it was established as a new, planned neighbourhood, with a <strong>Baroque grid layout</strong> that has been preserved almost intact. At that time it was a sandy area on the outskirts of the old walled city, which was reached through the <strong>Portal del Mar</strong>, the gate located approximately where the Museu d’Història de Catalunya is today, in the <strong>Palau del Mar</strong>.</p>
<p>Notable features from its early days are the long streets and terraced houses open to the sea, as well as the <strong>Baroque Sant Miquel church</strong>, which presides over the square of the same name, in the centre of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Barceloneta&#8217;s houses were occupied by sailors, fishermen, tradespeople linked to the sea and others from all over that came looking for cheap rents. Citizens all, who gave a unique character to this neighbourhood designed around the sea.</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century, fishermen gave way to workers from the metallurgical trades. The <strong>Catalana de Gas tower</strong>, an impressive pre-Modernista structure, still remains from this era, as well as <strong>Barceloneta market</strong>, which has been remodelled by the team of the late architect Enric Miralles, renovating the wrought iron structure and combining it with modern features. A place that is destined to become a reference in the neighbourhood and the city.</p>
<h3>Next to the beach</h3>
<p>The beginning of the 20th century saw Barcelona opening up to the beaches. The bathing areas, which began appearing all along the coast, were particularly important to the Barceloneta neighbourhood, as they meant the start of a new and thriving trade: food and drink. <strong>Bars, inns and restaurants</strong> provided food for the thousands of bathers who came here in search of the sea.</p>
<p>The Barcelona Olympics in 1992 meant another revolution for Barceloneta. The construction of the Olympic Village surrounded the traditional fishermen&#8217;s quarter with sculptures and modern buildings. Today, flanking the neighbourhood&#8217;s coastline is the <strong><em>El Peix</em> sculpture by Frank Gehry</strong>, an enormous golden fish that seems to float above the sea, while on the other side there is the huge sail-like silhouette of <strong>Hotel W</strong>. Two features that frame tradition with their modernity.</p>
<p>Barceloneta, in the middle, with chairs positioned outside doorways, washing hung out on balconies and the typical smell of fish in the air, is one of the most fascinating places where you will find authentic seaside life in Barcelona.</p>

<p>Passeig de Gràcia, which links the old town with Avda Diagonal, is so named because in times gone by it was the road linking old, walled Barcelona with the then town of Gràcia, today another city neighbourhood. At the end of the 19th century, when <strong>Ildefons Cerdà</strong> planned the city&#8217;s <strong>expansion</strong>, he turned this road into one of the main arteries of his project, making it very wide and prominent.</p>
<p>Its commercial importance attracted the <strong>wealthiest businessmen</strong>, who began to build their own buildings on the avenue and compete to see who had the most luxurious and extravagant house. This meant that the <strong>Modernista architects</strong> of the period were allowed to give free reign to their imaginations and design the magnificent buildings which give it its unique value today. <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, the most unique of all, designed Casa Milà, better known as <strong>La Pedrera </strong>(the quarry), with its surprising undulating facade, and <strong>Casa Batlló</strong>, with its dragon-shaped roof. Just next to it, <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong> built <strong>Casa Amatller</strong>, a house with a triangular facade in a colourful Modernista style reminiscent of Catalan Gothic, while further down, close to Plaça de Catalunya, <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong> constructed <strong>Casa Lleó Morera</strong>.</p>
<h3>Its own style</h3>
<p>Walking up or down Passeig de Gràcia lets your imagination roam over the fantastic shapes of the facades and the stained glass windows of the unique buildings to be found there and you can enjoy the sight of luxury boutiques, as the <strong>main establishments</strong> of the new city that moved into the ground floor of these buildings are still there. The best <strong>international brands</strong> have opened stores on Passeig de Gràcia too, alongside century-old boutiques like Santa Eulàlia, an icon of couture in the city.</p>

<p>A broad avenue over one and a half kilometres long, with <strong>mansions</strong> and <strong>gardens</strong> on either side where the city&#8217;s most well-off families could settle, away from the Eixample grid, the blocks of flats and the factories. An avenue where it would be possible to breathe the <strong>fresh mountain air</strong> and that, in part, imitated the big Parisian boulevards. This was the dream that Dr Andreu, a Barcelona doctor who had made a fortune from his famous cough sweets, realised in 1897.</p>
<p>Avinguda del Tibidabo has not changed its appearance in over a hundred years. It still maintains the <strong>garden-city</strong> design conceived by Dr Andreu, with its <strong>private mansions</strong> on both sides, for the most powerful families. This elegant avenue ends in <strong>Plaça del Doctor Andreu</strong> and is connected from the bottom to the top, by a tram: the <strong>Tramvia Blau del Tibidabo</strong>. Climbing on board is like entering a page of Barcelona&#8217;s history, the chapter in which the best architects of the <strong>Modernista era</strong>, such as Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Joan Rubió i Bellvé, Enric Sagnier and Adolf Ruiz Casamitjana built residences and mansions, each more spectacular than the last, competing in their style and how striking they were: Mediaevalist, Neo-Gothic, Modernista, Noucentista, with limitless possibilities. A funicular runs from Plaça del Dorctor Andreu to the top of Tibidabo, where there is a big amusement park and a church, the <strong>Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor.</strong></p>
<h3>Fairy-tale mansions and gardens</h3>
<p>From the <strong>Rotonda</strong>, an old Modernista-style hotel where the Tramvia Blau sets off from, the avenue opens in front of you. You can walk up, beginning with the <strong>Tamarita Gardens</strong>, a romantic oasis of plant life open to the public. As the avenue continues to climb you will see <strong>Casa Coll</strong>, Xalet Ignacio Portabella, <strong>the Roviralta</strong>, <strong>Casa Fornells</strong>, <strong>Casa Muley Afid </strong>– a mansion built by an uprooted sultan who ended up in Catalonia <strong>Casa Muntades</strong>, and so on till you reach Casa Evarist Arnús, <strong>the Pinar</strong> or pine forest, a Neo-Gothic mansion resembling a fairytale castle that is illuminated at night and forms part of the Tibidabo landscape.</p>
<p>There were no limits on this avenue, which housed the most important families in Barcelona. The zeal for demolition of the 1970s and 80s did not touch the avenue, where the houses have now become universities, colleges, consulates, advertising agencies and the occasional restaurant. All of them have preserved the splendour of Dr Andreu&#8217;s dream.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Back to the Middle Ages</h3>
<p>Walking aimlessly through the streets and squares of El Born and La Ribera transports you back to the Middle Ages, when this area was one of the city&#8217;s main districts, full of palaces and mansions built by the wealthy merchants. With imposing Gothic precincts like <strong>La Llotja</strong>, the exchange where they conducted the business that kept them going, but also numerous humble artisans, guilds and sailors who, in only 55 years, and without the help of the powerful classes, were able to build the <strong>Santa Maria del Mar church</strong>, the best example of Catalan Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>In 1714, the medieval district suffered the defeat in the War of Succession, and was severely damaged. In remembrance of those who fell in this war, a flame is kept burning in <strong>Fossar de les Moreres</strong>, next to Santa Maria del Mar. If you want to learn about the history of that time you should go to the <strong>Born Cultural Centre</strong>, a Modernista market converted into a museum which houses the remains of the city that disappeared under the bombs.</p>
<h3>A neighbourhood of artists, past and present</h3>
<p>La Ribera was, and still is, a neighbourhood of contrasts. Today, the palaces in <strong>Carrer Montcada</strong>, old mansions, are occupied by museums and art galleries, the most notable being the <strong>Museu Picasso</strong>, which holds the early work of this painting genius. Picasso had his workshop in the neighbourhood, as did the painters Rusiñol and Casas. In fact, there were so many artists who set up in La Ribera and El Born that these neighbourhoods were considered to be <strong>Barcelona&#8217;s Montmartre</strong>. The legacy of this can still be seen today, as many new creators have moved into iconic spaces, where new trends are found side-by-side with medieval remains and the memory of traders and merchants. It has become one of the most modern and cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in Barcelona, with the hippest fashion showrooms found alongside gourmet shops and the latest trends in restaurant culture.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A centennial history</h3>
<p>Open from Sants to the sea, El Paral·lel crosses three of the city&#8217;s districts (Sants-Montjuïc, Eixample and Ciutat Vella) with its own identity linked to its origins. The avenue was designed by architect and urban planner <strong>Ildefons Cerdà</strong>, who also created  the famous Eixample layout, and opened in 1894 in an area of vegetable plots and factories that seemed a no man&#8217;s land. There are various theories on why it is called Paral·lel, but the most surprising suggests that it is due to the fact that it coincides exactly with the <strong>41st parallel</strong>.</p>
<h3>Avenue of lights</h3>
<p>This so-called no man&#8217;s land very soon forgot its factory beginnings and today only the <strong>three chimneys</strong> of the old La Canadiense electric plant remain. Immediately it opened up to the world as one of Europe&#8217;s most important roads in terms of leisure activities, parties and scoundrels. El Paral·lel filled with cafes, theatres, music halls, circuses and cabarets, and vaudeville and cuplé held their own against the performances at the Liceu. There was fun to be had for all the working classes, who flocked here from the crowded neighbourhoods of Ciutat Vella. But El Paral·lel also attracted the rich and upper classes from the higher areas of the city, looking for an environment far from their stiff morals, as well as political radicals and anarchists, like Lerroux and El Noi del Sucre (the Sugar Boy), who wanted anonymity for their meetings among the masses who invaded this wide avenue. El Paral·lel had everything for everyone, and there were revues like those of the famous Bella Dorita, and works of playwrights such as Santiago Rusiñol, author of the famous play <em>L&#8217;auca del senyor Esteve </em>(Mr. Stephen&#8217;s Storybook).</p>
<p><strong>El Molino</strong>, one of the best-known burlesque cafes in Europe and a tribute to the Moulin Rouge in Paris, has been preserved from that time. But other playhouses, like the <strong>Apolo</strong>, <strong>Teatre Victòria</strong>, <strong>Condal</strong> and <strong>BARTS</strong> mean that the curtain is always about to go up.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Where it all began</h3>
<p>The two main buildings in Plaça de Sant Jaume are where many of the decisions are taken that affect the lives of the citizens Barcelona and Catalonia. On one side is the <strong>Palau de la Generalitat</strong>, with the statue of St George on the balcony, built in the 15th century. On the other is the Clock Building, <strong>City Hall</strong>, with its Neoclassical facade and statues of James l and the councillor, Joan Fiveller, flanking the entrance.</p>
<p>The Palau de la Generalitat is an<strong> eminently Gothic </strong>building that for the most part maintains its original appearance. The two side facades are Gothic but not the main one, which came later and is in the <strong>Renaissance style</strong> of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The Golden Chamber and the Orange-Tree Courtyard are also Renaissance, while the four columns at the entrance date from the 2nd century and come from a Roman temple in Tarragona. The Staircase of Honour and the statue of <strong>Sant Jordi</strong> (St George) on the facade were added in the 19th century.</p>
<p>As for City Hall, the <strong>Casa Gran</strong>, this dates back to 1369, when a start was made on the <strong>Saló de Cent</strong>, the Hall of One Hundred, to provide the councillors with a public building. The <strong>Gothic facade</strong> on Carrer de la Ciutat is still there, while the main, Neoclassical facade was built in 1847.</p>
<h3>The core of the city</h3>
<p>Plaça de Sant Jaume beats in time with the city. As well as having the two institutional buildings, it is an important public <strong>meeting point</strong>, where human-tower (<em>castell</em>) displays and concerts are held during the annual Mercè and Santa Eulàlia festivals, a Nativity scene (<em>pessebre</em>) is set up at Christmas and many demonstrations and rallies take place. It is also common to see newlyweds coming out of City Hall when they have just got married.</p>
<p>Leaving the square, a very short distance away are the Cathedral, the Rambla, the Boqueria and the Born, to mention just four iconic spots.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The beginning of the end</h3>
<p>On <strong>11 September 1714</strong>, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Barcelona surrendered to the Bourbon troops after 13 months of resistance and Philip V triumphantly entered the city. A harsh repression of both the populace and the Catalan institutions followed. Over time, 11 September became the <strong>National Day of Catalonia</strong>, the <strong><em>Diada</em></strong>, and the Fossar de les Moreres cemetery became the setting for annual political, social and cultural events.</p>
<h3>Defenders of the homeland</h3>
<p>At the side separating the square from the street, Carrer de Santa Maria, you can read an <strong>inscription</strong> taken from the famous poem by Frederic Soler <em>Pitarra</em>, paying tribute to those who fell during the siege:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Al fossar de les moreres / no s’hi enterra cap traïdor</em>; <em>/ fins perdent nostres banderes / serà l’urna de l’honor” (</em>In the graveyard of the mulberry trees / no traitor is buried / Even if we lose our flags / it will be our urn of honour)</p>
<p>These lines, which also appear on a commemorative plaque at the back of the square in the shade of the mulberry trees, refer to an <strong>episode during the</strong> <strong>siege</strong>, when apparently the gravedigger and his grandson refused to bury the corpse of an enemy soldier, despite the fact that he belonged to the same family (he was the son of the gravedigger and father of the grandson).</p>
<p>From a more universal perspective, the Fossar de les Moreres could be interpreted as a reminder of all anonymous combatants, a kind of <strong>tomb of the unknown soldier</strong> similar to those in other European cities.</p>
<p>The cemetery is right in the middle of the <strong>Ribera</strong> neighbourhood, surrounded by historical buildings and places of great heritage interest, such as the Church of Santa Maria del Mar itself, Carrer de Montcada and <strong>Passeig del Born</strong>, where centennial shops stand next to fashion boutiques.</p>

<p>The Vallcarca i els Penitents neighbourhood is one of the five that make up the district of Gràcia. It nestles between the <strong>Coll and Putxet hills</strong>. Vallcarca was formerly used as a <strong>summer holiday residence </strong>where families came to find peace and escape from the bustling city. Summer houses were built at the bottom of the hills, alongside the <strong>farmsteads of the peasants</strong> in the many crop fields in the area. A landscape that still amazes visitors as they look at the hills and see they are dotted with tiny houses built with a certain degree of haphazardness.</p>
<h3>The bridge of union</h3>
<p>On one side, the Coll and on the other, the Putxet, and in the centre a gulley that seemed impossible to cross until the bridge was built. Vallcarca Viaduct is a <strong>great civil engineering project</strong> by the architect Miquel Pasqual Tintorer, in which <strong>concrete reinforced with iron</strong> was used for the first time to anchor a construction to the bed of the gulley.</p>
<p>This way a passage was opened up <strong>between both hills,</strong> Coll and Putxet, allowing vehicles and people to cross from one side to the other. This also helped open up the neighbourhood to the city, as it made communications easier.</p>
<p>Crossing the viaduct is quite an experience, because it offers one of the most impressive <strong>views of Barcelona and the sea</strong>, since the Vallcarca i els Penitents neighbourhood is one of the highest points of the city.</p>

<p>The site of the Santa Creu d’Olorda chapel, which takes its name from the nearby peak of Puig d’Olorda, invites you to take part in all kinds of <strong>outdoor</strong> leisure activities and to discover the <strong>architectural and cultural heritage</strong> of the park. In addition to walking, admiring the views, hiking, and discovering the site&#8217;s flora and fauna and getting away from the city, a visit to the church can represent a true lesson in <strong>art history</strong>.</p>
<h3>Olorda’s heritage</h3>
<p>The earliest information we have about the founding of Santa Creu d’Olorda dates back to the <strong>9th century</strong>. The complex consisted of the chapel, cemetery, rectory and a castle. The apse and nave of the original church were built in the 9th century, and other elements were subsequently added and modified. The church was burned down in 1936 at the outbreak of the Civil War and it was later restored by the hiking group, Els Blaus de Sarrià.</p>
<p>For a short period there was a <strong>castle</strong> beside the church, but it is no longer there. It was built during the 14th century and belonged to King Peter of Aragon, who sold it. Unfortunately, documents from 1430 already mention it as a rundown, half-abandoned building. Other sites of interest in this area include the <strong>Torre del Bisbe</strong> (Bishop&#8217;s Tower) and the <strong>Font de Santa Margarita </strong>(Saint Margaret&#8217;s Fountain).</p>

This original centre <strong>keeps the Modernista entrance</strong> for carriages and carts, and has a stable for four horses, plus a <strong>permanent display</strong> of carriages and carts with historical pictures and explanations, a recreation of an old forge, and an exhibition space and conference room.</p>
<p>The building is managed by the Sant Andreu de Palomar <strong>Sant Antoni Abat Festival Society</strong>, which was founded in 1924. <strong>It can be visited from Tuesday to Sunday, between 10 am and 2 pm.</strong></p>
<h3>Tres Tombs festival</h3>
<p>Tres Tombs festivals are held <strong>all around Catalonia</strong> to mark the Feast of St Anthony the Abbot, the patron saint of animals, which takes place around 17 January. The main rituals involve riding around the interior of the old town <strong>three times with horses</strong>, carriages, carts and other beasts of burden. Hence the name Tres Tombs (three turns).</p>

<p>It looks like a giant stapler overhanging Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes. In fact it is the Disseny Hub building, which houses the Museu del Disseny de Barcelona. This new city architectural icon is in the <strong>22@ neighbourhood</strong>, in the district of Sant Martí. Technology, innovation and a strong commitment to design mean this is a must for museum fans, who will see a collection of more than 70,000 items as a result of merging the collections of the Gabinet de les Arts Gràfiques and the Decorative Arts, Textile and Clothing, and Ceramics museums. The building will also house the Foment de les Arts i el Disseny (Fostering Arts and Design) association, the Barcelona Centre de Disseny and a major collection of documentary resources on design.</p>
<p>A whole <strong>world of design</strong> gathered together in one, unique space structured on two levels, where one takes advantage of the different levels in the square, Plaça de les Glories Catalanes, and the other emerges at ground level. These are linked by a passageway that local residents are almost forced to go through and connects the remodelled square with the 22@ and Poblenou neighbourhoods. The <strong>glass and metal facade</strong>, combined with natural features such as the lake and the vertical gardens, adds a touch of green to the area.</p>
<h3>A smart building</h3>
<p>The building, conceived by the MBM team of architects, is a structure with a <strong>spectacular design</strong> and a very high degree of environmental quality. In fact, it is one of the most sustainable, energy self-sufficient buildings anywhere in the city and it has the <strong>highest efficiency rating</strong>.</p>
<p>Design at the service of the city and a museum that captures the essence of Barcelona by uniting knowledge of the past with a forward-looking approach in an <strong>innovative space</strong>, as innovative as the neighbourhood it is located in.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A meeting point</h3>
<p>Plaça de Catalunya was built in 1889, following Barcelona&#8217;s Universal Exhibition. Its purpose then, as it is today, was to link the new Eixample district with the old centre. From the beginning it has always been one of Barcelona&#8217;s breathing spaces, packed with cafés and restaurants that have seen literary and political debates, and which are still some of the main meeting points, even today. The square, which covers <strong>48,500 square metres</strong>, became a city icon and holds public events, concerts and various civic gatherings. These days it is a major hub and is, in fact, regarded as Barcelona&#8217;s nerve centre.</p>
<h3>A square with art</h3>
<p>It is surrounded by imposing buildings, and <strong>two big fountains</strong> add a touch of beauty to the upper side of this huge square, which is enriched with lots of urban art, <strong>sculptures</strong> such as <em>The Goddess</em>, by Josep Clarà; the Francesc Macià Monument by Josep Maria Subirachs; <em>The Shepherds</em>, by Pau Gargallo; and works by other artists, such as Josep Llimona and Enric Casanova.</p>
<p>Below ground lies <strong>Avinguda de la Llum</strong>, a large underground avenue that was one of the city&#8217;s first shopping centres and sparked the busy commercial activity in the square where, today, there are some big malls like El Triangle.</p>
<p>The extent of the city&#8217;s diversity is revealed in Plaça de Catalunya, a place where tourists, travellers, city dwellers and vendors, shops, and benches all meld together. Sitting on one of the benches or the terrace of the <strong>iconic Café Zurich</strong> and observing all this hustle and bustle makes you feel alive and part of Barcelona.</p>

<p>On La Rambla you can <strong><em>ramblejar</em></strong>, in other words, you can wander up and down time and again on Barcelona&#8217;s great boulevard, for nothing more than the pleasure it gives you, because it makes you feel at home. Because La Rambla is <strong>welcoming and inclusive</strong>. Here walk humble workers and the rich and powerful on their way to the Liceu, the shopkeepers from Ciutat Vella and the sailors who arrive in the port. Those who have lived here for years and those that are visiting for the first time. Everyone rambles on La Rambla. And this is the <strong>essence of Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>La Rambla’s five <em>ramblas</em></h3>
<p>When, in the 19th century, Barcelona broke free of its suffocating walls, it built a great promenade to join the upper part of the city, the mountain side, with Ciutat Vella, the sea side. La Rambla consists of <strong>five stretches</strong> with different names. Beginning in Plaça de Catalunya and heading down La Rambla, towards the port, is La <strong>Rambla de Canaletes</strong>, where you find the Font de Canaletes, a 19th century fountain. If you drink from it, they say you are sure to return to Barcelona. A little further down is La <strong>Rambla dels Estudis</strong>, so called because one of the city&#8217;s first universities was located here. It closed in the 18th century when Philip V abolished the Catalan universities. In this area you can also find <strong>Palau de la Virreina</strong>, a fine example of civil architecture and a great gift of love from the Viceroy of Peru to his second wife. Continuing towards the sea, you come to La <strong>Rambla de les Flors</strong>, the only place in 19th century Barcelona you could buy flowers, and which keeps the trade alive today. <strong>La Boqueria</strong> and the <strong>Liceu</strong>, one a temple to food and the other to music, begin the fourth Rambla, La <strong>Rambla dels Caputxins</strong>, so called because of the Capuchin monastery that used to be there. The fifth part, La <strong>Rambla de Santa Mónica</strong>, where traditionally the artists and painters are located, links this spectacular boulevard with the sea.</p>
<p>La Rambla, which used to connect Barcelona from top to bottom, is an unmissable part of the city, the avenue that everyone has to pass down at some moment or other. To experience La Rambla is to experience Barcelona.</p>

<p>Perched on the hill that borders Sants and looks towards the sea, Montjuïc has witnessed and been the setting for many momentous events in Barcelona&#8217;s history. It began to be developed round the 1929 <strong>International Exposition</strong>. Following the dramatic events of the Civil War, when the castle served as a prison, it changed and, with the 1992 <strong>Olympic Games</strong>, the change was completed. For the people of Barcelona it acquired a happy, festive character again.</p>
<p>The name of the hill, which is 177 metres high, has been the subject of controversy as, in medieval Catalan, Montjuïc could translate as &#8220;<strong>Jewish mountain</strong>&#8220;, an interpretation backed up by the existence of a Jewish cemetery there.</p>
<h3>Nature, culture and sport</h3>
<p>There are lots of gardens on this big, green, city lung where you can walk, rest, play, do sport or just enjoy nature. The <strong>Jardí Botànic</strong> lays out its collection of Mediterranean plants on steep slopes that provide a great viewpoint. You can also enjoy the plants and views in the <strong>Jardins de Mossèn Costa i Llobera</strong>, featuring cactus, and the <strong>Jardins de </strong><strong>Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer</strong>,where the numerous species means there are flowers in bloom all year round. The<strong> Jardins de Laribal</strong>, with their surprising waterfalls, hide the popular <strong>Font del Gat</strong>, a fountain where Barcelona folk went to picnic on Sundays in the past. And the <strong>Jardins Joan Brossa</strong>, among the newest gardens, open out into a refreshing woodland park, with musical cushions, games and zip lines here and there to amuse the kids.</p>
<p>Dotted with cultural and sports facilities, such as the Miró Foundation, CaixaForum, Bernat Picornell Swimming Pools and the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium, Montjuïc offers culture, nature and history all in one. The Magic Fountain (Font Màgica) and Spanish Village (Poble Espanyol) are two of the sights that most appeal to visitors in an enormous natural space full of hidden corners waiting to be discovered.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A reclaimed factory</h3>
<p>Built in the 19th century as a <strong>textile mill</strong>, Can Batlló, with a surface area comparable to that of the Camp Nou football stadium, originally stood next to El Vapor Vell i l’Espanya Industrial, one of the most important <strong>factory complexes </strong>of the time. Today, after more than 30 years in disuse, it is a space that is once again bustling with activity and initiative, which has been handed over to the public and is managed by the people of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>In 2009, the local residents set up the platform <strong>&#8220;Can Batlló és pel barri&#8221;</strong> (Can Batlló belongs to the neighbourhood) and, thanks to this social movement, in 2011 the people were given permanent rights to use one of the buildings, known as <strong>Bloc Onze</strong>. Workshops on infrastructure, carpentry, circus skills, and musical creation are just some of the activities on the long list that have, little by little, filled the space and created a <strong>mini-universe </strong>that attracts everyone to it, crossing the borders of the La Bordeta neighbourhood and extending as far as the people of Sants, Badal, and even further afield.</p>
<h3>A neighbourhood&#8217;s heart</h3>
<p>At the same time the number of initiatives has also increased, amongst which is the work of the <strong>Arquitectes de la Col</strong>, a group of young architecture professionals who joined the local residents in their fight and who took on the responsibility for breathing new life into the abandoned industrial units.</p>
<p>As well as being a multifunctional place for expression and creativity, open to everyone, Can Batlló has become a <strong>symbol of culture </strong>and <strong>horizontal organisation</strong>, an integral part of the La Bordeta neighbourhood and the Sants-Montjuïc district.</p>

<p>It offers a number of amenities so everyone can enjoy a green space that extends up to <strong>Parc de Collserola</strong>. The benches, fountains and children&#8217;s play area, plus large stretches of grass and sand for running, walking and cycling, invite everyone to <strong>relax and get a little closer to nature</strong>.</p>
<h3>Two philosophies</h3>
<p>The park also has <strong>Mediterranean plants</strong> that flower all year round. Its bushes, climbing and ground-covering plants, along with the <strong>Collserola allotments</strong> very close by, contribute towards the spirit of <strong>sustainability and autonomy</strong> encouraged in the city.</p>

<p>In keeping with the times and <strong>sustainability criteria </strong>promoted by the city, Parc de les Rieres d’Horta, which opened in 2013, follows the philosophy of <strong>self-sustainability </strong>and has a photovoltaic pergola which uses the <strong>sun&#8217;s energy </strong>to power the lighting system, which also uses LED technology.</p>
<p>Built over the facilities that house the street cleaning vehicles and a rainwater catchment tank, both of which are underground, the park derives its name from the abundance <strong>of wells and streams </strong>and hydraulic resources in the area, which are due to its proximity to the <strong>Collserola range</strong>. The history of the Horta neighbourhood is closely linked to this abundance of water and the old municipality of Sant Joan d’Horta even became famous for the floods the area suffered in the past.</p>
<h3>Knowledge of nature and sustainability</h3>
<p>The trees found in the park offer an <strong>educational botanical route </strong>which includes 23 different species and 25 different plants that have been planted in accordance with climatic conditions and their ability to survive and thrive in an urban environment. Most of the species are warm climate <strong>Mediterranean species </strong>that require less maintenance.</p>
<p>As a whole, the new Rieres d’Horta Park is an example of <strong>modern times </strong>and sustainability, promoted in Barcelona in accordance with the <strong>new philosophies </strong>and respect for the <strong>environment</strong>.</p>

<p>The Ateneu de Fabricació Digital in Les Corts is based on the American <strong>Fab Lab</strong> concept, inspired by the research and technological production laboratories of the famous <strong>Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</strong>, which were set up in the year 2000. Its philosophy is to promote home-grown creation and collaboration between all kinds of people interested in science and technology, providing them with access to resources that would be beyond their reach financially.</p>
<p>In 2013, on the initiative of Barcelona City Council, it was decided to create the Les Corts Ateneu de Fabricació Digital, with the aim of creating a <strong>space for debate and technological creation</strong> that was within everyone&#8217;s reach and today it serves as a place where all those who wish to do so can express their <strong>talent and creativity</strong>, as it is the first public Fab Lab in the world.</p>
<h3>Technology within everyone&#8217;s reach</h3>
<p>The centre, close to Plaça del Centre, is housed in the old <strong>Benet Campadabal</strong> factory, measuring more than 1,000 square metres, and it provides members of the public with access to 3D printers, mechanisation centres, 3D scanners and a laser cutter, among many other pieces of equipment, enabling them to turn their ideas into physical products which are useful to society. The Ateneu also offers workshops, conferences, talks and all kinds of events that also aim to promote the <strong>social cohesion and integration </strong>of all groups of people. The space is being prepared to house a library which will occupy a large part of the building.</p>

<p>Light, ventilation and hygiene. These were the three basic premises for building the Casa Bloc flats during the Second Republic, for workers who, at the time, were still living in the slums of Sant Andreu&#8217;s industrial neighbourhoods. Plans were drawn up to build <strong>200 flats</strong>, where the architects Josep Lluís Sert, Joan Baptista Subirana and Josep Torres Clavé, who belonged to the <strong>rationalist movement</strong> and were members of the GATCPAC (Group of Catalan Artists and Technicians for Progress in Contemporary Architecture), who wanted to create a clean, bright affordable environment that would make life easier for workers.</p>
<p>The large S formed by the <strong>five buildings</strong> consisted of maisonettes open to the exterior, which always had <strong>natural light</strong>, and there were no interior courtyards, so all the flats looked out onto the street on both sides, providing them with more effective ventilation. Each block was built on pillars to allow their inhabitants easy access and create <strong>green spaces</strong>. The project was not finished under the Republic but it was under the Franco regime. Consequently, what had originally been planned as workers&#8217; housing ended up becoming flats for army men, war widows and, later, national police officers.</p>
<h3>A 1930s flat</h3>
<p>The Disseny Hub de Barcelona has renovated one of the flats as a <strong>flat-museum</strong>, restoring the original hydraulic paving, the foldable doors (taken from other flats in disuse), the economical kitchens, the laundry with shower, separate toilet, and even original 1930s furniture. A flat-museum you can visit to see how <strong>rationalist</strong> <strong>architecture</strong> thought about functional houses that would bring dignity to the harsh living conditions of workers in Sant Andreu.</p>

The store where you can still buy candles of all shapes and colours made with traditional craftsmanship, was designed in 1847 as a luxury clothing store. Even today retains the bifurcating Baroque staircase and Baroque columns resting on huge sculptures.</p>
<h3>A candle-making dynasty</h3>
<p>Just after the war, Paulí Subirà bought the shop and his son still runs it. It is one of the city&#8217;s many historical and iconic shops and continues to offer a product that is no longer a necessity and has become a cult object from the past.</p>

<p>The aim of the Eix Comercial Poblenou, which can be summed up by the association&#8217;s slogan &#8220;We are your neighbourhood, we are your commerce&#8221;, is to give support to shops that sell a <strong>wide variety of products.</strong> These include shops selling food, children&#8217;s products, fashion clothes and accessories, health and beauty products, and household items, as well as bars and restaurants. Besides events and activities at special times such as Christmas, the association organises some to <strong>boost and strengthen</strong> Poblenou&#8217;s retail trade. For example, it holds a Street Market every second Saturday of the month so shopkeepers can display their produce outside the shop.</p>
<h3>Not to be missed</h3>
<p>One event not to be missed and which has become a traditions which attracts people from outside the neighbourhood is the <strong>Craft Beer Festival</strong>, first held in July 2012 on the initiative of some of the association&#8217;s members. On top of that, every summer they organise the <strong>Summer Market</strong>, which gives shops the chance to display their goods on the Rambla del Poblenou and make themselves known among the locals.</p>

<p>The station was built by the architect Pere Falqués in 1915, after a typhus epidemic had broken out in the city precisely as a result of contaminated water. The <strong>Modernista-inspired </strong>structure was built on the grounds of today’s Parc de les Aigües in the Trinitat Vella neighbourhood and entered into service in 1919. Casa de l’Aigua remained operational for most of the century and its pumps were stopped only once for about a year due to the floods in 1962.</p>
<h3>A building at the neighbourhood’s service</h3>
<p>The Museum of History of Barcelona, together with different institutions in the Sant Andreu and Nou Barris districts, is working on a process to adapt all the facilities and open them to the public. The goal is to make it possible for <strong>visitors to view the main facilities</strong>, such as the Trinitat Vella pumping station and water tank and the pipes that connect them and the rest of the city, in order to show how the supply of drinking water to large cities worked. Casa de l’Aigua has housed a vocational training centre since the early twenty-first century and also gave its name to a new underground station when the Metro reached the neighbourhood in 2003.</p>

It was the setting of Barcelona&#8217;s surrender during the Catalan Revolt in 1652 and defeat following the city&#8217;s siege in 1714, during the <strong>War of the Spanish Succession</strong>, after which it housed the high command of the Bourbon troops. The bandit Perot Rocaguinarda is also said to have lived there. It was taken over by the Guinardó Owners and Residents Association in 1906 and has been the Centre&#8217;s headquarters since 2011.</p>

<p>The Vallvidrera reservoir was designed in 1865 for a <strong>hydraulic project</strong> that the civil engineer Elies Rogent carried out to bring <strong>drinking water</strong> to the old town of Sarrià. Today it is no longer used to supply water and has become a <strong>leisure spot for enjoying natural surroundings</strong> and relaxing with family and friends, immersed in its fauna and flora.</p>
<h3>Natural paths</h3>
<p>One of the best ways to get to there is to set off from <strong>Plaça de la Mina Grott</strong> and follow the reservoir path. The Mina Grott is a <strong>tunnel almost 1 km long</strong> that was built to link the reservoir with Sarrià when it supplied water but later, when if fell into disuse, it became a path that people climbed from Barcelona to enjoy the <strong>natural surroundings of Collserola</strong>. Today the tunnel is closed but you can follow a path parallel to it between the trees until you reach the <strong>pink house</strong>, which used to be the house of the reservoir watchman and has now been restored by the <strong>Collserola Trust.</strong></p>
<p>Taking a stroll through this natural spot so close to the city and discovering the <strong>reservoir&#8217;s inhabitants</strong>, such as the green frog, the tree frog and the parsley frog, can be a real <strong>experience</strong> for young and old alike.</p>

<p>Inextricably linked to the <strong>identity of both</strong> <strong>Barcelona and Catalonia</strong>, the Modernista movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is present in <strong>aesthetic and intellectual contexts</strong> that form an indelible part of the city&#8217;s history. The Museum of Catalan Modernisme enables visitors to discover this rich heritage.</p>
<h3>The importance of Modernisme</h3>
<p>The museum is located in the Eixample district, near <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> and <strong>Rambla de Catalunya</strong>, and is housed in a Modernista building designed in 1902 by the <strong>architect Enric Sagnier</strong>. It was established at the initiative of two Barcelonan antique dealers, <strong>Fernando Pinós and Maria Guirao</strong>, who, having devoted 40 years to Catalan Modernisme, assembled a 350-piece collection.</p>
<p>Outstanding figures from that glorious period, such as <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, Josep Llimona, <strong>Puig i Cadafalch </strong>and Enrique Clarasó, amongst others, are all represented in the museum, which embraces a full <strong>range of artistic</strong> <strong>disciplines</strong>, including painting, sculpture, furniture and decorative arts.</p>

It is a small, sheltered area, an ideal place for <strong>enjoying nature </strong>while relaxing or reading. The renovation work conserved the original design&#8217;s mosaics, paths and steps. Local residents campaigned to make the gardens a city facility, and prevented flats being built on the site.</p>
<h3>From a modernista house to college</h3>
<p>The house that crowns the gardens is a wonderful example of the most austere Modernisme, with <strong>facing-brick trimmings </strong>on the facade and under the windows. The roof, which is split into two sections by a <strong>terrace with wooden balustrades</strong>, is one of the most spectacular parts of the building. It is listed as a Cultural Asset of Local Interest (BCIL).</p>

<p>From a textile mill to a museum of contemporary painting. Can Framis, an old <strong>textile factory</strong> dating back to the 18th century and now a museum, is a place for <strong>contemplating art</strong>, an area where innovation and new production methods are leaving their mark. The idea was not to leave this past behind, so in reclaiming this old wool mill, at first glance a building with hardly any architectural interest, it was decided to use materials that would form a <strong>collage of textures</strong>. The museum, with its rough concrete, bare brick walls and boarded up windows, all covered with a sheen of grey paint, seeks to represent the <strong>passing of time</strong> and show how the different interventions have turned the Can Framis wool mill into one of the city&#8217;s most interesting pictorial museums. The <strong>quiet Miquel Martí i Pol Gardens</strong>, with their neutral colours and whites, poplar trees silently caressing the benches and the ivy that covers the avenue, are a respite from the hyperactive 22@ neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>An oasis of art</h3>
<p>The Can Framis collection is a Vila Casas Foundation project with some 600 paintings and <strong>contemporary artworks</strong> from the 1960s to the present day. The whole complex, comprising the museum, factory buildings and gardens, contrasts with the technology that surrounds it, a half-hidden <strong>oasis of peace</strong> well worth a visit.</p>

<p>Built in 1929 for the <strong>International Exposition in Barcelona,</strong> the <strong>cable car </strong>was the brainchild of the architect Carles Buïgas to join the wharf in Barceloneta to Montjuïc mountain. During the Spanish Civil War it stopped running and the towers that link the cables became strategic attack points. After some remodelling, the cable car route came back into service in 1963 and in the 1990s work was done to modernise it.</p>
<h3>A 10-minute flight</h3>
<p>Especially appreciated by tourists, <strong>the cable car has three stations</strong>: Torre de Sant Sebastià, at Barceloneta beach; Torre de Jaume I, in the middle of Port Vell and the Miramar area on Montjuïc mountain. Each day the cabins carry <strong>more than two thousand people </strong>keen to savour the <strong>exceptional views </strong>offered by this aerial experience across Barcelona. The journey is <strong>three thousand metres long </strong>and made in simple cabins, not too different from the original ones.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A floating building</h3>
<p>The Torre de Gas stands next to the <strong>Ronda del Litoral ring road</strong>, almost on the beach. The best-known part of the building is the enormous 20-storey tower that can be seen from all around. Close up, you can see the building&#8217;s true dimensions: there are three interconnected <strong>geometric, glass-covered buildings</strong>, on several levels. The 20-storey office tower, comprises 22,000 square metres of usable space. The second block is a <strong>spectacular rectangular</strong> <strong>prism </strong>that sticks horizontally out from the central tower, suspended in the air. Finally, attached to the tower,  is a third area with four floors.The most spectacular thing about the building the way it <strong> reflects its surroundings</strong>: the building floats, reminiscent of the walkways that connect to aircraft and reflects everything around and the light of the sky.</p>
<h3>Play of light</h3>
<p>Designed by the architects Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue, the Torre del Gas is thoroughly integrated into its environment and has transformed the city&#8217;s skyline. When the sun shines brightly, even from the furthest hills you can spot this<strong> silver tower that seems to be emerging from the sea</strong>. In fact, it is this glass covering that means the building is in a <strong>permanent state of metamorphosis</strong>: it is never the same, you never see it looking the same way twice. Everything depends on the place you are looking at it from in the city and the light falling from the sky.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Poblenou&#8217;s lung</h3>
<p>Designed by the French architect <strong>Jean Nouvel</strong>, Poblenou&#8217;s innovative Parc del Centre opened in the spring of 2008. Covering <strong>5.5 hectares </strong>, this huge green lung lies between Carrer de Bilbao, Carrer de Marroc, Bac de Roda and Avinguda Diagonal, which define the <strong>inclusive, social spirit</strong> of the new Poblenou neighbourhood.</p>
<p><strong>Curious shapes and abundant vegetation</strong> welcome and accompany visitors from the entrance, where a large perimeter wall covered with Mediterranean plants allows access to the park interior through a Gaudï-style gate.</p>
<p>The park, designed to facilitate <strong>nature breaks</strong> and conceived with everyone in mind, has areas for walking, courts for various games and charming spots to enjoy a spot of reading. Right in the middle there is <strong>Plaça de la Sardana</strong>, a meeting point surrounded by huts where kids can play.</p>
<h3>Design and sustainability</h3>
<p>The concern with <strong>preserving the environment</strong> is reflected in some features of the park, for example, a pneumatic refuse-collection plant hidden in an area resembling a <strong>lunar landscape</strong>, or the irrigation system that uses groundwater.</p>
<p>Nouvel wanted this <strong>signature park</strong> to be a place that combined different habitats, so he created three clearly differentiated areas. The <em>Cràter-pou del Món</em>, probably the most surprising, is a spiral path surrounded by bougainvillaea that looks like a volcanic crater. <em>Nius i Pous del Cel</em> (nests and cells) is a space with large metal structures covered in climbing plants and flowers. And the <em>Voltes i Falgueres Gegants</em> lead to the lunar landscape under four fern-covered arches. It is worth sitting and resting on one of the metal chairs designed by the architect that are submerged in the shade of the park&#8217;s lush, colourful, plants and trees.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Threading the past</h3>
<p>The sirens that signalled the times when workers entered and left Fabra i Coats were also those that regulated life in the old town of Sant Andreu. The <strong>Hilaturas de Fabra i Coats</strong> company became the main production centre for Sant Andreu&#8217;s local residents, along with Ca l’Alzina, also known as Can Mamella, which provided work for over 1,500 people at the beginning of the 20th century, giving jobs to many women and providing subsistence to many families. Fabra i Coats stood on an <strong>industrial site</strong> occupying two whole blocks that today, thanks to the efforts of local people, have been turned into a <strong>space reclaimed </strong>for public use: 30,000 square metres housing a large cultural and social centre.</p>
<p>The cotton spinning company was set up in 1839 but it was not until 1903, when it merged with the Scottish company J&amp;P Coats, that it acquired the name it became known by everywhere, Fabra i Coats. And it adopted a <strong>surprising business model</strong> for the time, introducing improvements for the workers such as paid holidays, onsite nursery schools and healthcare.</p>
<h3>The factory in the 21st century</h3>
<p>Fabra i Coats gave <strong>Sant Andreu</strong> an industrial colony that remains to this day. Industrial reconversion led to the factory&#8217;s closure but the City Council bought the land and factory premises for cultural use.  Fabra i Coats, having sustained generations and generations of Sant Andreu&#8217;s local residents, reinvented itself to become a first-class <strong>cultural centre</strong>: the Can Fabra Centre.</p>
<p>The Fabra i Coats industrial grounds currently holds an artistic-creation laboratory, the Fabra i Coats &#8211; Creation Factory, the Contemporary Art Centre, the Can Fontanet &#8211; Els Tres Tombs Information Centre, the Sant Andreu neighbourhood centre and the Josep Bota social and cultural space, among other benchmark places. It also includes Can Fabra, the old Rec Factory building built around 1880, which became a cultural centre containing the Ignasi Iglésias Library and Musicians’ Workshop. Where before workers spun cotton thread, today their grandchildren and great grandchildren enjoy themselves, grow up and create art.</p>

It is<strong> open throughout the year</strong>.</p>
<h3>A taste of Mediterranean vegetation</h3>
<p>The vegetation of the park, which extends for nearly <strong>two hectare</strong>s, is made up of Mediterranean species selected because they adapt well to the city&#8217;s urban environment and climate. There are <strong>23 species</strong> of shrubs, notably boxes, mastic trees, rose bushes and lavender, while among the trees, the Aleppo pines, abele, cherry and cork oak varieties stand out.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The cactus park</h3>
<p>Among the strange and curious spots found in Barcelona, the Costa i Llobera Gardens, situated at the foot of <strong>Montjuïc</strong> facing the sea, are one of the most special. The gardens stretch over six hectares and offer a <strong>journey to faraway lands </strong>through some of the most exotic cactus species on the planet. Semi-desert, tropical and desert species, and others from high mountain regions. The area where the park is located has its own <strong>microclimate </strong>with an average temperature that is two to three degrees warmer than the rest of the city, making it the perfect place for these types of plants.</p>
<h3>One of the best gardens in the world</h3>
<p>The Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens were created in 1970 and are named after the <strong>Mallorcan poet </strong>Miquel Costa i Llobera, author of the poem <em>El Pi de Formentor</em>. It was a joint venture undertaken by the architect Joan Maria Casamor and a teacher from the gardening school who specialises in succulent plants, Joan Pañella. Since their inauguration, the gardens have undergone an extensive <strong>remodelling process</strong>, with the replanting of a large number of plants that fell victim to the icy weather of 1985 and 1987. Despite this, the New York Times published an article declaring them to the be among the best gardens in the world. As well as the 800 species of <strong>cactus and succulent plants</strong>, the gardens offer stunning <strong>panoramic views </strong>over the city&#8217;s coastline and port. They are just ten minutes from the Columbus statue and the Rambla Santa Mònica and, although they have been there a while, they are relatively unknown, even among local residents. A tour of this enormous park is a live, open-air lesson on the most impressive succulent plants, which are very different from the type of vegetation you tend to find in a Mediterranean climate like Barcelona&#8217;s.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Fun and shock value</h3>
<p>Since 1898 this theatre has been a fixture at the end of <strong>Avinguda del Paral·lel</strong>, an area that was previously considered to be the Broadway of Barcelona or the Catalan Montmartre due to the number of <strong>theatres and concert</strong> <strong>cafes </strong>located there. El Molino has lived through and survived everything, and is now one of the oldest and most important theatres on this celebrated boulevard.</p>
<p>With a <strong>tradition of breaking</strong> new ground, this theatre has always been appreciated for its ability to escape censure, by creating its <strong>own language</strong> of double entendre that pushes the boundaries of acceptability.</p>
<h3>A name with history</h3>
<p>Originally christened <strong>La Pajarera Catalana </strong>(the Catalan birdcage), it was renamed the <strong>Petit Moulin Rouge</strong> after being renovated in 1910. In 1929 it got a new, specially made facade and the red windmill sails alluding to its name, which it kept until the end of the Spanish Civil War. With the establishment of the dictatorship, the Franco regime forced the name to be changed to Spanish and the word &#8220;rouge&#8221; had to be removed because of the political connotations of the colour red. The new Molino continued its run until 1997, when it closed.</p>
<p>Bought by the Catalan group Ociopuro, who began a complete renovation, but keeping the unique facade from 1929, El Molino once again opened its doors in 2010, proud to be what it is. Each evening, just as it has done throughout its long history, it offers music hall, burlesque shows and flamenco dances, as well as being a restaurant and disco.</p>

Now run by several of Gràcia&#8217;s popular culture associations, it offers <strong>a welcoming cafeteria</strong> but devotes its space to <strong>organising cultural activities</strong>. The <i>geganter</i>s (giant carriers), <i>trabucaire</i>s (blunderbuss-wielding bandits), <i>bastoner</i>s (stick dancers]), La Vella de Gràcia <i>castellers </i>(human-tower group) and the Esbart Lluís Millet <i>dansaires </i>(folk dancers), among other groups, are all based here. It also has a space for older people.</p>
<h3>Lots of activity</h3>
<p>The centre organises <strong>chats, talks</strong>, concerts and exhibitions and offers workshops of every kind, not always connected to popular culture. They range from yoga for kids, pattern designing and dressmaking, to music IT and beginner&#8217;s lessons for <i>ball de bot</i>, a traditional Balearic island dance. It also has <strong>rooms for rent</strong> and two soundproof rehearsal spaces.</p>

<p>Until recently, factories and other industrial sites here extended almost down to the shoreline.

<p>It is the <strong>most recently created</strong> beach and has been open since 2006. This explains why there are not many facilities there. In fact, there is not even a beach bar, a <em>chiringuito</em>. One of the few facilities there are is a volleyball area to the west, next to the breakwater separating it from the Nova Mar Bella Beach.</p>
<h3>Relaxation and peace and quiet</h3>
<p>Still, if you are looking for <strong>relaxation and peace and quiet</strong>, this is the best beach for being on your own, with your partner or with the family, if you do not want to go out of Barcelona.</p>
<p>Next to Mar Bella and 374 metres long, this is an <strong>urban beach</strong> with the modern Diagonal Mar as a backdrop. Although it is some way out, it is easy to get to by car because there is a disused piece of land next to it that serves as a car park.</p>

Built in 1733, it was one of the buildings that <strong>Philip V</strong> had built after the War of the Spanish Succession to keep the city under his thumb. It was refurbished in 2005 and is listed as a <strong>Cultural Asset of Local Interest</strong> but presently closed to the public.</p>

<p>La Magòria station, which served the Barcelona-Manresa line, is at the junction between Gran Via and Carrer del Moianès. Its sloping roofs are made of <strong>Arabic tiles</strong>, its facade features a combination of masonry and irregular ashlars and the tower has a stucco finish. The openings of the two facades appear framed in brick, which outlines the entire perimeter of the tower and the building. <strong>Visiting times</strong> are from Mondays to Fridays, 10 am to 9 pm.</p>
<h3>Josep Domènech i Estapà</h3>
<p>The architect Josep Domènech i Estapà, a professor of Geodesy and Descriptive Geometry at the University of Barcelona, developed his <strong>own style</strong> based on classical architectural styles, <strong>distancing himself from the fashionable trends</strong> of his day, such as Modernisme. Among other buildings, he designed the <strong>Palau de Justícia</strong>, the Palau Ramon and the Empar de Santa Llúcia shelter for the blind, later the Museu de la Ciència de Barcelona and now <strong>CosmoCaixa</strong>.</p>

<p>El Palauet Living Barcelona is the name of the hotel that now uses this former family residence.

<p>Besides the stone-sculpted base of the <strong>bay window</strong>, another notable feature on its main facade is the <strong>wrought ironwork</strong> and the upper, Baroque-inspired crown. The rear facade&#8217;s semicircular tower of bay windows with stained glass is another example of the elegance of Barcelona&#8217;s Modernisme.</p>
<h3>The high-society avenue</h3>
<p>Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie began to set up residence on Passeig de Gràcia during the last third of the 19th century. Exuberant buildings were raised on either side of the city&#8217;s<strong> most exclusive street</strong>, vying with one another in opulence, and the Casa Bonaventura Ferrer proved no exception here.</p>

<p>The <strong>famous</strong> <strong>Jaume Fuster Library</strong> in Gràcia&#8217;s Plaça de Lesseps stands out with its<strong> luminous geometric structure.</strong> It was built on the former site of a metro garage and workshop, which was abandoned for many years.</p>
<p>This building, of enormous architectural value, was built by the <strong>architect Josep</strong> <strong>Llinàs and earned him the 2006 FAD prize for architecture, </strong>one of the most important awards in this field that is granted in Spain.</p>
<h3>A reading space</h3>
<p>The building, the inside of which is equally impressive as the outside, has one of the best library collections in the city, with <strong>more than 104,000 items</strong> available for public use. In addition it has a <strong>local collection</strong> with <strong>historical documents</strong> that include references to the district of Gràcia and to local literary writers who lived or have lived in Gràcia.</p>
<p>With almost 2,000 daily users and following its transformation into one of the most active cultural spaces in the neighbourhood, the library <strong>organises activities</strong> for children and adults, workshops, reading clubs, exhibitions and many other proposals in which participation is free. It is a real pleasure to visit Plaça de Lesseps and enter one of the <strong>cultural thermometers</strong> of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>For those who have always preferred a swimming pool, the Fòrum bathing area has established itself as a place where you can do what you do at the beach but <strong>without having to traipse across the sand</strong>. Access to the water in the bathing area, which is 375 metres long and 30 metres wide, is via steps, directly from the <strong>paved surface</strong>. And if you prefer to jump or dive into the water while doing some fancy flips, there is no problem because it is deep here.</p>
<p>Sand is a barrier for people who use wheelchairs. So the bathing area has a <strong>specific area</strong> for people with disabilities or reduced mobility. This is the <strong>only beach</strong> in Barcelona with systems designed to give everyone access to the sea. A <strong>hydraulic chair lift</strong> makes it easier to get in and out of the water, giving everyone the chance to take a dip. The <strong>assisted bathing service</strong> starts in the summer, when a Red Cross worker helps people with reduced mobility bathe in the sea.</p>
<h3>Urban planning model</h3>
<p>This modern urban beach, by the waters lapping Parc del Fòrum, is a real example of Barcelona&#8217;s capacity for <strong>urban regeneration</strong>. It is located on the municipal boundary between Barcelona and Sant Adrià de Besòs and, because it has excellent links with the bike lanes along the shoreline, it has become the favourite beach of cyclists.</p>

<p>Located right at the entrance to Parc de la Creueta del Coll, Finca Sansalvador was built by the architect <strong>Josep Maria Jujol</strong>, a disciple of Gaudí, at the request of <strong>Dr Sansalvador</strong> and it became known as a curious site in the <strong>Gràcia neighbourhood</strong>. At first, the owner intended to build a <strong>summer residence</strong> facing Passeig de la Mare de Déu del Coll and build another house to be rented out at the top part. The curious thing is that, during the execution work, a <strong>water mine</strong> with alleged radiological and medicinal properties was discovered which the doctor decided to market under the <strong>Agua Radial </strong>brand. For this reason, Sansalvador changed his original plan and built a series of <strong>grottos to access </strong>the spring, to take the water to the bottling plant, and a romantic garden to incorporate them into a natural landscape, even though the water did not turn out to be as miraculous as he thought.</p>
<h3>Jujol</h3>
<p>Today, all that remains of the interrupted project is the <strong>porter&#8217;s lodge</strong>, a small house with a small balcony decorated with coloured ceramic tiles that was recently renovated, in keeping with the original design, especially the garden, with a series of <strong>underground tunnels</strong> which can be accessed through some magnificent parabolic arches that lead to the water spring<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Finca Sansalvador currently houses the <strong>History Workshop of Gràcia</strong> which often organises open-house events.</p>

<p>The current Vall d’Hebron secondary school is located in the former <strong>Can Besora estate</strong>, the farmhouse that gave its name to the land between Passeig de la Vall d’Hebron, the former Sant Genís road, and the Collserola stream. It was demolished in the 1920s. It had room for <strong>800 children</strong>, though it never housed more than 200, but it operated as an orphanage right until <strong>the beginning of the 1970s</strong>, after which it was auctioned off. Thanks to the local-resident action requiring the building to be used for education, <strong>the City Council eventually bought it</strong> and converted it into a secondary school.</p>
<h3>A building ahead of its time</h3>
<p>Sagnier designed the orphanage-school following the <strong>Montessori method</strong>. It was a building ahead of its time, with large, well-lit study rooms, laboratories, a cinema, an infirmary and even X-ray equipment. It closed in 1972 and was <strong>about to be demolished</strong>, but the local residents prevented it. It continues to house students today and is listed in the municipal catalogue of protected buildings.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Life on the docks</h3>
<p>Moll de la Fusta was officially called Bosch i Alsina in honour of the Catalan politician and entrepreneur of that name who had made his fortune in Cuba. Even so, and as often happens with emblematic spaces, its correct name is hardly ever used by anybody.</p>
<p>This <strong>coastal walkway </strong>brings you to the Palau de Mar, the Maremágnum shopping centre and the Columbus viewing point, as well as a number of other emblematic spots. At night, the docks are a lively place through which people pass on their way to the nearby <strong>entertainment areas </strong>of the Maremágnum centre, El Born and La Rambla. However, it has not always been like this: the poet <strong>Joan Salvat-Papasseit</strong>:</p>
<p>described how tough life was at the docks nearly a century ago:<br />“<em>Heus aquí: jo he guardat fusta al moll.</em><br /><em>Vosaltres no sabeu</em><br /><em>què és</em><br /><em>guardar fusta al moll:</em><br /><em>però jo he vist la pluja</em><br /><em>a barrals</em><br /><em>sobre els bots,</em><br /><em>i dessota els taulons arraulir-se el preu fet de l’angoixa;</em><br /><em>sota els flandes</em><br /><em>i els melis,</em><br /><em>sota els cedres sagrats</em>.”<br /><em>Nocturn per a acordió</em> (1925)<br />(&#8220;Behold: I&#8217;ve stored wood on the docks.<br />You don&#8217;t know<br />what it is<br />to store wood on the docks:<br />besides I&#8217;ve seen it bucket<br />down<br />on the boats,<br />and under planks at a fixed price<br />for my troubles;<br />under pines from Flanders<br />and melis,<br />under sacred cedars.”<br /><em>Nocturne for accordion</em> (1925)</p>
<h3>The prawn of Barcelona</h3>
<p>On the upper level of the former docks, there used to be several restaurants but these have since disappeared. One of these was the Gambrinus Restaurant and its roof was capped with a <strong>gigantic 15-metre long prawn</strong>. This prawn was the work of the designer <strong>Mariscal</strong> and it is currently owned by Barcelona City Council, which decided to keep it at the original location even though the restaurant is no longer there. Today, it is one of the city&#8217;s most curious icons. A little further on, and dominating the viewing point of Port Vell, pop artist Roy Lichtenstein’s Barcelona Face sculpture fills the surrounding area with colour.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A castle in the city</h3>
<p>Located on the edge of Parc de la Ciutadella, the Castle of the Three Dragons had to function as an <strong>architectural feature</strong> and as a café-restaurant during the months of the Universal Exhibition of 1888. However, some problems that arose during the execution of the work led <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong> to abandon the project, and it was finished by another architect shortly before the Exhibition ended.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the relatively modest success of its beginnings, the Castle of the Three Dragons, which took its name from a play by Serafí Pitarra, soon became a symbol of Modernista Barcelona.</p>
<h3>A scientific and Modernista soul</h3>
<p>The Castle of the Three Dragons brings together some of the most characteristic features of <strong>Catalan Modernisme</strong>: brick construction employing majestic and fanciful shapes (in this case, a castle with a square floor plan and four towers), the use of wrought iron and ceramics for the decor, etc.</p>
<p>The building has had many uses since it was built: a few years after the end of the Universal Exhibition, it reopened as a Museum of History, and in 1920 it was re-furbished to house the Museum of Zoology. It is currently one of the four main centres of the <strong>Museo de Ciencias Naturales</strong> and is dedicated to the research, conservation and dissemination of the museum&#8217;s collections as well as the publication of specialised works. A large part of its data are accessible online through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility portal.</p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s Natural Science Museum has four centres in three of the city&#8217;s iconic parks: Ciutadella, Montjuïc and the Fòrum. The latest opened in 2011 in Parc del Fòrum, taking advantage of its proximity to the sea, and is called the <strong>Museu Blau</strong>, or Blue Museum.</p>
<p>It is housed in the building constructed for the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the architects who designed that, Herzog De Meuron, adapted it for the museum, as well as designing the main exhibition area.</p>
<p>This exhibition, <strong><em>Planet Life</em></strong>, invites visitors on a journey through the history of life and its evolution in line with our planet, and a visit to the museum, with its innovative layout, approach and interactive audiovisual resources, is a great way of discovering and understanding nature&#8217;s secrets.</p>
<h3>Innovation, science and fun</h3>
<p>With9,000 square metresof facilities and services, the Museu Blau also offers temporary exhibitions, a Media Library, the <strong>Science Nest</strong> for children aged 0 to 6 and a function room. On top of that it holds talks and workshops, making it a truly <strong>active, living centre</strong>.</p>
<p>The new museum&#8217;s <strong>innovative cultural approach</strong> combines <strong>scientific rigour</strong> with a <strong>sense of fun</strong>. This makes it possible to combine concepts that, at first site, appear mutually opposed. Because here it is understood that an understanding of nature and serious debate on contemporary environmental issues can go hand in hand with <strong>fun and recreation</strong>.</p>

<p>Casa Fuster, which is considered by experts to be an exercise in <strong>expressive contention,</strong> is an extremely<strong> elegant building</strong> designed by one of the great <strong>Modernista architects,</strong> Lluís <strong>Domènech i Montaner</strong>, at the beginning of the 20th century, following the request of the lawyer Marià Fuster.</p>
<p>Designed and built between <strong>1908 and 1911</strong>, the main material used was <strong>white marble</strong>, in keeping with the classic features of the artist&#8217;s work: Robust columns with a red stone base, floral ornamentation inspired by nature and trilobed windows. In addition, both its main facades are built around a <strong>rostrum in the shape of a tower</strong> that rises to the top of the building. in accordance with <strong>more rationalist lines</strong>, the building is topped by a series of curious garrets in the French style, which are quite unusual in <strong>Catalan Modernista architecture</strong>.</p>
<h3>A hotel with a luxurious past</h3>
<p>For decades, Casa Fuster housed the offices of the Enher electricity company and many famous people have lived there. Illustrious residents include the poet <strong>Salvador Espriu</strong>, to whom the gardens in front of the building are dedicated, on the last section of Passeig de Gràcia.</p>
<p>Today, following a renovation process carried out in 2004, Casa Fuster is now a <strong>luxury hotel </strong>owned by the Center company. This renovation also included restoring the famous Cafè Vienès, a truly unique space which was formerly a meeting point for artists and intellectuals, where fantastic <strong>jazz sessions </strong>are now held every Thursday.</p>

Notable examples of this have been the second BCNswim, the Urban Suzuki Experience and the <strong>Barcelona Beach Festival</strong>, which attracted over 25,000 people. Set to open soon is Amnesia, a huge disco designed by the architect Jean Nouvel. This architecturally very ambitious project aims to make it one of the top night clubs in Barcelona.</p>

<p>The Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB) opened on 15 May 2006. It is the result of a joint initiative of the Generalitat (regional government) of Catalonia, Barcelona City Council and Pompeu Fabra University. Most of the activities developed at the park are financed with public funding and it organises <strong>tours and open workshops</strong> to offer citizens a chance to get a first-hand view of how it works.</p>
<p>The Park is made up of <strong>seven institutions</strong>: the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute, the Department of Experimental and Health Sciences at Pompeu Fabra University, the Centre for Genomic Regulation, the Barcelona Centre for Regenerative Medicine, the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology, the Pasqual Maragall Foundation and the Institute of Evolutionary Biology. All of these centres are organised according to a <strong>cooperative model</strong> that is also committed to the environment and energy saving.</p>
<h3>A building for the 21st century</h3>
<p>The large and impressive Park headquarters were designed by Manel Brullet and Albert de Pineda. They consist of an <strong>oval-shaped building</strong> with an open space in the middle, and they cover an area of 55,000m<sup>2</sup> spread out over several levels. The floors are arranged in a horseshoe shape around a central courtyard that has been left empty and this space looks out on the sea. The exterior wood-panelled façade is suspended above the ground and this increases the sense of <strong>lightness</strong>. At first sight, the building appears as though suspended in the air and seems to be only resting gently on the ground floor.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Surrounded by nostalgia and the smell of the sea, <strong>Passeig de l’Escullera</strong> is inseparable from Barcelona and since its <strong>construction in 1904</strong> as part of a project by the engineer Carlos de Angulo, it has been part of the lives of the port inhabitants and the city itself. <strong>Popularly known as El Trencaones</strong>, the breakwater&#8217;s <strong>golden age was the 1940s</strong>, when everyone went there to eat muscles and sardines in the iconic Porta Coeli restaurant, which even appears in one of the novels of the writer Vázquez Montalbán.</p>
<h3>An inspirational place</h3>
<p>After its first <strong>remodelling at the end of the 1950s</strong>, El Trencaones was converted into a wide boulevard. Back in the old days, you used to be able to go down it by car, but for some time now the vehicles have been banned from the entrance, although you can still get to the beginning of the upper breakwater by car, where you can park and walk down towards the sea.</p>
<p>These days, Passeig de l’Escullera is <strong>five kilometres long </strong>and, after many periods of remodelling, has become <strong>the perfect place for many runners and walkers</strong> as well as a few fishermen. This is the place that inspired the song <i>Rompeolas</i>, by the Barcelona singer Loquillo.</p>

<p>The Torre de les Aigües del Besòs was a water tower built between 1880 and 1882 to <strong>supply the city with drinking water</strong>. The Barcelona industrialist Xavier Camps, working with the <strong>Sant Martí de Provençals</strong> municipal architect Pere Falqués, was behind it and the complex was erected very near the mouth of the Besòs to <strong>draw and pump water </strong>from the right side of the river bed. But the project did not last very long because the water became salty. Despite that, the complex was used for a century to produce water for industry. It was <strong>fully operational until 1992</strong>.</p>
<h3>Iconic poblenou vantage point</h3>
<p>The renovation that got underway in 2010 and allowed this emblematic construction to be restored was ambitious and meticulous. It was restored <strong>brick by brick</strong> and both the tower&#8217;s stairs, 50 meters high, and the bannisters were faithfully restored. Today it has been turned into<strong> a privileged vantage point in the heart of Sant Martí</strong> that is open to the public.</p>

<h3>Homage to Catalan poets</h3>
<p>Staying true to the idea of dedicating Montjuïc&#8217;s gardens to <strong>Catalan poets</strong>, these gardens are named after and pay homage to Joan Brossa, with a plaque at the entrance and a <strong>visual poem</strong> inside. Their location connects them with Montjuïc&#8217;s other gardens, such as the Jardins de Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer and the Jardí Botànic.</p>

<p>This health centre located in the Raval neighbourhood was the first rational public building to be constructed in the city. The Republican Government chose its architects well: the government promoted modern medical care and the group of architects who were commissioned to build the clinic, all members of GATPAC (Group of Catalan Artists and Technicians for the Progress of Contemporary Architecture), were in favour of architecture that put space in the service of people. The building, located between Ronda Sant Antoni and Carrer Montalegre, became a paradigm of rationalism: straight lines, geometric shapes and usable spaces.</p>
<h3>A primary health care centre</h3>
<p>Made up of three blocks, each intended for different uses, the building has <strong>a central garden </strong>to counteract the <strong>patients&#8217; sense of isolation</strong>. It was renovated and modernised in the early 1980s. It is now home to one of the primary care centres in the Raval neighbourhood and remains a leader in the treatment of tuberculosis. It can be visited from Mondays to Fridays in the morning.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Mediterranean roots</h3>
<p>Considered to be the pearls of <strong>Montjuïc</strong>, the Laribal gardens extend across a number of different spaces, together creating a unique place of great historical value where it is a real pleasure to take a stroll. The silence of the vegetation and the gentle bubbling sound of the water, the main protagonist, create a <strong>haven of peace</strong>, not far from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
<p> Associated with the International Exposition of 1929, the Laribal gardens were completed in 1922 and were among the most important installations created for this event. Their designers, Jean-Claude-Nicolas&nbsp;Forestier and Nicolau M. Rubió i Tudurí, wanted to create a new style of Mediterranean landscape, inspired by the ancient Arabian gardens and the <em>&#8216;Cármenes</em>&#8216; of Granada, featuring decorative tiles, ornamental water features and flowering plants in pots on railings.</p>
<h3>Nature and water</h3>
<p>Architecturally, they are comprised of a <strong>series of terraces </strong>joined together by small paths and shortcuts, stairways and enormous pergolas, stones, pillars and fountains offering up jets of cooling water. Sculptures include <em>Estival </em>by Jaume Otero, a female nude in marble, <em>La Noia de la trena</em> by Josep Viladomat, another female nude, this time in bronze, and an enamelled ceramic fountain, the work of ceramicist Llorenç Artigas.</p>
<p> The Generalife stands out for its sheer beauty and historical importance. It connects the Laribal gardens to the Grec Theatre and is inspired by the Generalife gardens of Granada, with water cascading down the handrails, stone ponds and benches for resting on, next to a 19th century building which, in the past, was home to the former owner of the estate, Josep Laribal, and which has now been converted into a restaurant. All together, the Laribal gardens are an exquisite architectural, historical and natural space within Montjuïc park where it is a real pleasure to spend time relaxing and enjoying the tranquility.</p>

<p>After you have climbed the first group of steps, you will find a small path marked out by <strong>wrought-iron railings</strong> that takes you to the terrace-mirador, from where you can enjoy <strong>impressive views of the city</strong>: Collserola, Tibidabo and, in the background, the Coastal range and Montseny. A pergola covered in <strong>climbing plants</strong> and split in two by the stairs crosses the gardens. This is a great place for enjoying the shade. Further up, you will find a second terrace, covered by a section of the pergola. With its <strong>geometric beds</strong> of aromatic plants, this is also a good place for contemplating the city.</p>
<h3>The Grec Festival</h3>
<p>The <strong>old quarry</strong> that used to dominate this area made it possible to build an amphitheatre, where the <strong>traditional Grec Festival</strong> performances are held. The Grec is an international festival of theatre, dance and music that has been held every summer in Barcelona for <strong>over 40 years</strong>. Above the terrace there is a raised area dominated by a <strong>pavilion that houses a restaurant</strong> during the theatre season.</p>

<p>Designed by <strong>Carme Fiol </strong>and<strong> Andreu Arriola</strong>, the park was opened at the end of the 1990s. Within its almost <strong>18 hectares</strong> you can find many pleasant spots, as well as neighbourhood service buildings. The <strong>former Santa Creu asylum</strong>, which dates from the end of the 19th century, is today a busy place, home to the public library, the municipal archives and the Nou Barris Council.</p>
<h3>Lakes and old constructions</h3>
<p>The <strong>two lakes</strong>, divided by Passeig de Fabra i Puig, are another of this park&#8217;s attractions and many local residents come to play or spend a quiet moment here. The <strong>30 plus species of trees</strong> and the <strong>130 palms</strong> provide a place for learning and relaxing in.</p>
<p>The former <strong>Dos Rius aqueduct</strong>, which crosses over the lake to join Nou Barris with Horta-Guinardó, and the <strong>old country houses</strong> of Can Carreras and Can Ensenya, are a little bit of history to be enjoyed in the open air.</p>

<p>Between Montjuïc Castle and the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium are the Barcelona Botanical Gardens, spanning <strong>14 hectares</strong>, with a shape reminiscent of a large amphitheatre<strong>.</strong>The gardens are especially dedicated to Mediterranean plant species from around the world and it is home to thousands of varieties and routes for learning and enjoying the green spaces.</p>
<h3>Historical gardens</h3>
<p>The history of the botanical gardens, created by architects Carles Ferrater, Josep Lluís Canosa and Bet Figueras, date back to the <strong>1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, </strong>when the construction of new access routes to Montjuïc led to the closure of the old <strong>Historical botanical gardens </strong>and the creation of the new ones, which opened in 1999. The project was carried out by Barcelona City Council on a piece of what was previously disused land in the area around Montjuïc.</p>
<p>In the <strong>form of an </strong>amphitheatre with steep slopes, the gardens are divided into the five regions of the Mediterranean and offer a representation of the five characteristic landscapes of these regions.<br /> Furthermore, <strong>the magnificent views</strong> over the Llobregat delta,the Olympic Ring and part of the metropolitan area of Barcelona are another good reason to visit this splendid park.</p>

<p>Parc de Diagonal Mar, set in the <strong>new Fòrum Barcelona</strong> on a disused factory site, is spread over 14 hectares that branch out in different directions, merging with the city and creating a very open, natural space.</p>
<p>Each part links with the others in a kind of <strong>puzzle</strong> through paths which also branch out and with the help of some very large benches that remind you of the <strong>sea&#8217;s waves</strong>.</p>
<p>The park was the brainchild of the husband-and-wife team of architects Benedetta Tagliabue and Enric Miralles. It opened in 2002 and marked the culmination of their idea of <strong>innovative and sustainable architecture</strong>.</p>
<h3>Contemporary wetlands</h3>
<p>According to people who worked with them, the day they visited the site it had rained and it was covered by pools of water and seagulls. That image immediately gave them the idea of creating a space that would evoke <strong>wetlands</strong>. A place where the green of the grass and plants would mix with the blue of the water in the big lake, the pools and the fountains, producing a <strong>fusion of colours</strong> right across the park.</p>
<p>A raised tubular structure, like a spider&#8217;s web and spreading out in all directions, watches over the park. Here and there this moving line coils round suspended plant plots in a style reminiscent of <strong>Gaudí&#8217;s organic architecture</strong>. This tube contains the water that, apart from irrigating the whole park, unites the different parts: a large kids&#8217; play area, wavy tubular structures, a large central square, etc.</p>
<p>This immense <strong>sunny, open, accessible</strong> space makes Parc de Diagonal Mar the ideal place for walking, doing some sport, playing or even sailing some small model boats.</p>

<p>Designed by Enric Penyes, Can Dragó is an area of transition, halfway between Avinguda Meridiana and the Sant Andreu Cemetery. Covering nearly <strong>12 hectares</strong>,it is a vast expanse of land that incorporates various <strong>sports facilities</strong>, such as the largest covered swimming pools in the city, an athletics track, a multipurpose sports centre, a golf course and lots of recreation and amusement areas for its visitors.</p>
<p> It was opened in the 1990s and is named after a <strong>17th-century farmhouse</strong> called Can Dragó that was demolished in 1973.It has been gradually expanding ever since it opened to become the <strong>multipurpose</strong> <strong>recreation park </strong>it is today.</p>
<h3>Gardens for you to enjoy</h3>
<p>The park area, specially designed for <strong>pedestrians and cyclists</strong>, can easily be crossed by the <strong>tree and bench</strong> lined avenues that separate it from the sports facilities</p>
<p> One of its more notable <strong>artistic attractions</strong>, standing on a grassy promontory in the middle of the park, is the replica of a sculpture designed by Pablo Gargallo,namely the <em>Olympic Aurigas</em> (charioteers).</p>
<p> Walking or cycling among the <strong>acacias,poplars and plane trees</strong> can be a real luxury, a short escape from the enormous tower blocks you find in Nou Barris.</p>

<h3>A great neighbourhood garden</h3>
<p>The gardens have open spaces and grass parterres, along with a labyrinthine network of paths under the shade of its trees, passing through areas where you can sit and relax. There is a large tarmacked area for activities like <strong>neighbourhood festivals </strong>and <strong>sports competitions</strong>. There is also a special area for <strong>senior citizens</strong>, with different kinds of apparatus for keeping fit and making park visits more entertaining, a toy library, a children&#8217;s games area and pétanque courts.</p>

<h3>A Mediterranean park</h3>
<p>Parc de les Cascades contains a <strong>good selection of Mediterranean flora</strong>, with Aleppo and stone pines, rosewoods [from Bolivia], plane trees, European nettle trees and cypresses, as well as the beautiful jacarandas [from the Americas], which fill with splendid blue flowers in the summer. There are also olives, the Mediterranean tree par excellence and the unmistakable Barcelona palms.</p>

<p>During the Spanish Civil War, Barcelona was the first city to be <strong>systematically bombed </strong>from the air. The city&#8217;s people set up the Passive Defence Council, which built a great number of <strong>air-raid shelters </strong>around Barcelona to protect themselves. There is evidence of almost 1,300 bomb shelters, and that of <strong>Poble-sec</strong> was among the largest, able to hold around 2000 people.</p>
<p>Built by the <strong>local residents </strong>themselves, Refugi 307 takes advantage of the topography and the <strong>slope of Montjuïc</strong>, where it is located, which enables it to have a street-level entrance at the end of Carrer Nou de la Rambla. Inside, it opens up into a <strong>network </strong>of almost 400 m of <strong>tunnels</strong>, which have electricity, a toilet, kitchen, seating and a play area for the little ones, as well as a <strong>small nursing station </strong>that could tend to the injured.</p>
<h3>Indelible memory</h3>
<p>As a historical location testifying to the difficulties of that era, today Refugi 307 is managed by the Museu d’Història de Barcelona (MUHBA). A <strong>guided tour </strong>allows you to walk through the tunnels and see the elements that still remain from those times, like posters stuck on the wall specifying some surprising <strong>rules for coexistence</strong>, such as forbidding you to talk about politics and religion or foster pessimism. A real legacy of the <strong>atrocities of war</strong>.</p>

<p>El Carmel was a rural area during the early 19th century, with a few scattered farmhouses, notable among which was Can Móra, after which the Muntanya Pelada hill was then known. Its current name derives from the Sanctuary of Nostra Senyora del Carmel, which was built between 1860 and 1864. The little church was built under an initiative from the <strong>hermit Miquel Viladoms</strong>, and years later, it was extended with a new and more contemporary church designed by the architects <strong>Francesc de Paula Daumal </strong>i<strong> Domènech and Miquel Campos Pascual</strong>. The first houses began to be built on the hill in 1875 and these gradually became what is now the El Carmel neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>The best views of barcelona</h3>
<p>Very near the sanctuary is the <strong>Hermitage of Nostra Senyora de Fàtima</strong>, two schools and two football pitches. Beside the Virolai school there is a vantage point with <strong>one of the best panoramic views </strong>of the city.</p>
<p>The park is set around the <strong>El Carmel hill</strong>, at 256 metres in height. It is separated from the Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí) by the <strong>Can Móra road</strong>, which marks the border between the districts of Horta-Guinardó and Gràcia.</p>

<p>Dominated by the <strong>Palau</strong><strong> Reial Major</strong>, Plaça del Rei &nbsp;initially served as the palace courtyard and, later, markets and even tournaments were held there. The centre of power of the medieval city, the Palau, built in the 9th century, was the official residence of the Catalan counts from the 8th century to the early 15th century. Even though it contains Visigothic and Roman remains, the style of the building is predominantly Gothic. Its most emblematic room, today a must-visit exhibition room, is the <strong>Saló del</strong><strong> Tinell</strong>, featuring a series of semicircular arches of great architectural value.</p>
<h3>Medieval and Roman legacy&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On one side of the Palau Reial is the<strong> Torre</strong><strong> Mirador del Rei Martí</strong> (King Martin&#8217;s Watchtower) and on another side, on Barcelona&#8217;s old Roman wall is the royal chapel of <strong>Santa</strong><strong> Àgata</strong>, with ceilings and altarpieces by Jaume Huguet inside. In front is the <strong>Palau</strong><strong> del Lloctinent,</strong> (now the Archive of the Crown of Aragon), which dates back to the 16th century and boasts a valuable Renaissance patio in its interior. </p>
<p> Rounding off this architectural group in the square is the old <strong>Casa</strong><strong> Clariana-Padellàs</strong>, which is currently home to the Museu d&#8217;Història de Barcelona (MUHBA) which, beneath its floors, hides traces of streets, houses and shops from the Roman Barcino. The value of this square, in terms of the history of Barcelona, invites you to go on a journey to the past and to breathe in the nobility hidden within its thousand-year-old walls.</p>

<p>Given the lack of places for artistic production, Hangar was set up in 1997 to provide artists and creators with <strong>a place where they could work</strong> and share their knowledge. The centre also offers advice, hires out video and photographic equipment and studios, and invites artists to apply for grants and residencies. Hangar is run by the <strong>Visual Artists of Catalonia Association</strong> (AAVC). It is financed by public and private subsidies from bodies such as Barcelona City Council, the Catalan Government and Banc de Sabadell.</p>
<h3>Our heritage</h3>
<p>Hangar is housed in the <strong>Can Ricart</strong> industrial complex, declared a Cultural Asset of National Interest (BCIN) and currently municipally owned. The factory building dates from the middle of the 19th century and was built as a <strong>textile mill producing printed fabrics</strong>. Notable features include the chimney stacks, the clock tower and the sober style the architect Josep Oriol i Bernadet gave to the whole site.</p>

It boasts a very rich and varied selection of shops and other establishments, ranging from fashion shops and perfumeries to iconic restaurants such as <strong>Botafumeiro</strong>, delicatessens, electrical-goods stores, ecological shops and beauty salons. There&#8217;s nothing better to round off an afternoon&#8217;s shopping than going into the heart of the neighbourhood and enjoying its <strong>bohemian and informal</strong> atmosphere.</p>

<p>The Palau de Congressos de Barcelona is part of the <strong>International Exposition of 1929</strong> complex, for which some <strong>fifteen palaces </strong>were built, as well as numerous national and commercial pavilions, a stadium, a swimming pool and the architectural reproductions that make up the Poble Espanyol, or Spanish Village. Six large palaces were built on the lower part of the mountain, by <strong>Plaça d’Espanya</strong>, as exhibition halls and for many years they hosted the annual multi-trade <strong>Fira de Mostres, </strong>in addition to single-trade fairs and exhibitions. And standing either side of the stone stairs are the two tall buildings designed by <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong>: the Alfons XIII and Queen Victòria Eugènia palaces. Their towers are reproductions of the ones found on the Pont Reial in Valencia.</p>
<h3>Fira de Barcelona: an entity of public interest</h3>

            "#text": "<h3>A park that opens up to the sea</h3>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Parc de la Barceloneta</strong> was opened in 1996 and links the Ronda del Litoral ring road and the sea front. The architects Jordi Henrich and Olga Tarrasó made good use of space and the park sits on the land of the former <strong>Catalana de Gas factory</strong>,<strong> </strong>which was in use up until 1989. It is a <strong>wide, open space </strong>full of tamarisk, pine and rosewood offering locals an opportunity for relaxing and enjoying the countryside while enjoying the Mediterranean sea.</p>
<h3>Reusing space</h3>
<p>Large and divided into three areas, the Parc de la Barceloneta still preserves some of the buildings from when this area was the site of a gas factory. One of the most important is the well-known <strong>Torre de les Aigües</strong>, built in 1907 by the architect Josep Domènech i Estapà. The building stands out for its Modernista style, a characteristic feature of that time, with its conical brick roof, <strong>ornamented with Trencadís </strong>made of tile fragments.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fàbrica del Sol</strong> is another iconic area in Parc de la Barceloneta. This is another building designed by Josep Domènech i Estapà and is currently the headquarters of <strong>Recursos de Barcelona Sostenible</strong>, which is dedicated to environmental education.</p>
<p>As well as displaying historical relics of neighbourhood&#8217;s past, the park also offers <strong>more popular services</strong>; there is a children&#8217;s play area, boules courts, <strong>basketball courts, table tennis tables and</strong> even a football pitch. <strong></strong></p>

<p>Also known as the <strong>Pavelló Alemany</strong> (German Pavilion),&nbsp;the Mies van&nbsp;der&nbsp;Rohe Pavilion,hidden away in a corner of Montjuic Park,is a world famous construction and architectural landmark from the early avant-garde period of the 1920s. The architect Mies van der Rohe, who was also director of the Bauhaus, designed this building to represent Germany in the Barcelona International Exposition of 1929. Known as the father of modern architecture, Van der Rohe incorporated in the design of this building the basis of his philosophy: perfect symmetry, translucent spaces, clarity, simplicity and minimalism. This is how he wanted to represent the Germany of the Weimar Republic following the First World War, and this building was intended to be a symbol of all these elements.</p>
<h3>Faithful design</h3>
<p>The pavilion was removed in 1930 and in 1989 it was decided to reconstruct it due to the importance of its design as a piece of <strong>modern architecture</strong>.The four different types of marble originally used, Roman travertine, green marble from the Alps, ancient green marble from Greece and golden onyx from the Atlas Mountains, were also used in the reconstruction, along with the sculpture of George Kolbe strategically located next to the pond, playing with the light and reflections of the water. Currently home to a <strong>Foundation,</strong> the building is open to the public and is mainly dedicated to disseminating the work of the architect and to promoting the debate on architecture and modern and contemporary art.</p>

<p>The white roof of Casa Sayrach looks as if it is melting in the sun&#8217;s heat, while the <strong>undulating lines</strong> create a sense of movement and relate directly to the work of Antoni Gaudí, who Sayrach knew all about. Casa Sayrach forms a corner: its vertex is finished off with a column of semicircular bay windows, topped with a tower, and on the Avinguda de la Diagonal side there is an entrance with a bay window over it which describes a parabolic arch. The whole facade, of unadorned smooth stone, is reminiscent of Gaudí&#8217;s masterpiece, the Pedrera, a few streets away.</p>
<h3>Disturbing beauty</h3>
<p>The entrance hallway of the house is like some fantastic scene. Organic forms, conveying a sense of movement, and, above all, <strong>anatomically inspired </strong>lines, dominate: on the ceiling, the arch that leads to the stairs resembles the bony structure of a spinal column.</p>

<p>Casa Vilaró stands out for its modernity.

Decades of opulent buildings, overbearing decoration and expensive materials were being left behind. Reinforced concrete and metal structures were the mouthpiece of the new <strong>Rationalist era</strong> entering the country from Europe and the United States.</p>
<h3>A stay at &#8220;Casa Vaixell&#8221;</h3>
<p>You can stay at Casa Vilaró. The house, which has kept part of its original <strong>decoration</strong> and <strong>furniture</strong>, is rented out to families and companies. Its design has not passed its sell-by date almost 100 years after it was built, it stands in idyllic surroundings (next to Park Güell) and it has a magnificent terrace offering views of the whole of Barcelona and the sea.</p>

<p>On the border between the Eixample and Sant Martí, almost touching the Poblenou neighbourhood, Plaça de les Glòries was built as a meeting point for the city&#8217;s three main roads: <strong>Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes</strong>, <strong>Avinguda Meridiana</strong> and <strong>Avinguda Diagonal</strong>. And given the spirit of constant renovation that imbues Barcelona, it has been redesigned several times in the course of its history to improve access to the city.</p>
<h3>Culture and avant garde</h3>
<p>The area around it, combining an atmosphere of popular tradition and radical modernity, constitutes an extremely important <strong>cultural and architectural microcosm</strong>. This is where you will find two outstanding cultural centres, the <strong>Teatre Nacional de Catalunya</strong> and the <strong>Auditori</strong> concert hall. Alongside these, other notable buildings include the famous <strong>Torre Agbar</strong>, by the French architect Jean Nouvel, the <strong>Disseny Hub</strong> design centre building and the new <strong>Mercat dels Encants</strong> building which, since 2013 has housed the popular Fira de Bellcaire, an old flea market traditionally held on one of the sites around the square but now sheltered under the impressive, ultramodern structure of this triangular building. It is worth wandering round the stalls and having a look for treasures.</p>

<p>Its name, meaning &#8220;new pitch&#8221;, comes from the fact that before this stadium was inaugurated in 1957, Barça played on the <strong>old pitch in Les Corts</strong>, which was much smaller and simpler. The need to build this <strong>new stadium</strong> principally came about in the 1950s with the massive popularisation of football in Spain and the arrival of Ladislao Kubala at the club in 1951.</p>
<h3>Much more than a football club</h3>
<p>Inside theCamp Nou facilities are the official headquarters of <strong>Futbol Club Barcelona</strong>, the administrative offices and the Museu del FC Barcelona, the <strong>club&#8217;s museum</strong>, which is the most visited in Catalonia. Additionally, Camp Nou is the main building in a complex which houses other facilities, such as the smaller stadium, the <strong>Mini Estadi</strong>, the <strong>Masia</strong>, the residence were the club&#8217;s youngest footballers were raised, and the <strong>Palau Blaugrana</strong>, a sports  hall where the club&#8217;s basketball, handball, roller hockey and indoor football&nbsp;teams train and play.</p>
<p>The <strong >Camp Nou</strong> stadium is one of the city&#8217;s icons, a place to enjoy football and live the emotions of this most passionate of sports.</p>

<p><strong>Recreational sailing</strong>, in any of its forms, is a pleasure that can almost become an addiction and is associated with strong <strong>feelings of freedom and adventure</strong>. Whether kayaking on your own or setting sail on the <em>Icària</em> – the centre’s impressive flagship racing sailboat – the <strong>adventure of the sea</strong> has a powerful effect. Beach activities such as volleyball competitions also take place at the water sports centre, where the facilities include a <strong>restaurant with terrace</strong> right on the beach, open to all.</p>
<h3>Enjoying the sea safely</h3>
<p>Avoiding risks when sailing is essential. For this reason, the Mar Bella water sports centre specialises in water sports<strong> training</strong> <strong>and education</strong> and is certified as a sea school by the Government of Catalonia. The centre runs courses leading to various <strong>nautical qualifications</strong>, such as the yacht or pleasure-boat skipper’s certificates, as well as training in the basic skills for sailing a catamaran, cruiser or kayak, windsurfing, etc. The school offers training in different kinds of water sports to both children and adults, as well as transmitting a love for the sea without neglecting the importance of safety and risk prevention when sailing.</p>

<h3>Much more than just shops</h3>
<p>There are few shopping centres such as the Maremàgnum. Besides its wide range of boutiques it also boasts a full programme of activities for all ages, such as the urban <strong>Downtown Market</strong>, held each first weekend in the month and the special events for particular dates, such as Christmas or Saint Valentine&#8217;s day. Throughout the rest of the year there are craft fairs, displays by <i>castellers </i>[human-tower builders], visits from giant and &#8220;big-head&#8221; figures, shows for kids, live music, dance displays and a whole lot more.</p>
<h3>Views of the city and the murmur of the sea</h3>
<p>The Maremàgnum is located in front of Port Vell, with several means of access: the most spectacular without doubt is from the floating bridge at the end of the Rambla, opposite the Columbus monument, and now known as the Rambla del Mar.</p>

The other entrance, by <strong>Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes</strong>, takes visitors along a path that links the park to Carrer de la Font Florida. The path passes over the slope which, tracing the <strong>mountain&#8217;s profile</strong>, is covered with grass, pine, holm oak, poplar, ombú and eucalyptus trees. Mediterranean shrubs such as <strong>broom and lavender </strong>grow below, while leafy jacarandas decorate the area at the top. The central square is dominated by tipuanas, which have a spectacular yellow flower.</p>
<h3>How the park looked in 1929</h3>
<p>The park was created in 1995, emulating the style of gardens that Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier had designed on Montjuïc for the <strong>Barcelona International Exposition </strong>of 1929.</p>

<p>Parc del Mirador del Poble-Sec is an extensive and well laid-out park that is turning into an urban garden bridging Montjuïc&#8217;s woodland landscape with the neighbourhood of Poble-Sec. It offers <strong>pétanque courts and children&#8217;s play areas</strong>, as well as recreational spaces shaded by trees and a pergola covered with climbing plants. One end has a pond full of aquatic vegetation which collects water from the 18-metre-high cascade delivered from the small pool above. The species of trees include jacarandas, Mediterranean hackberries, holm oaks, acacias, <strong>elms, cypresses and Peruvian peppers</strong>. The large recreational area has a pergola covered in Chinese wisteria and Virginia creeper.</p>
<h3>A recreational area</h3>
<p>Montjuïc was a recreational area for Barcelona&#8217;s residents, from the end of the 19th century up to the second half of the 20th, when they would go up there for barbecues or a breath of fresh air. Apart from the military castle, <strong>the land was privately owned</strong> and divided into three large estates for hunting and agriculture. In preparation for the <strong>Barcelona International Exposition </strong>of 1929, the City Council began to buy land on Montjuïc and landscape it.</p>

<p>Also know as the Portal Miralles, the big entrance gate to the Finca Miralles is one of the least-known of <strong>Gaudí&#8217;s works</strong> in the city. It stands on <strong>Passeig de Manuel Girona</strong>, in Sarrià, and can <strong>be visited in peace</strong>, without the crowds usually attracted by the legacy of this brilliant architect. Inspired by the shapes <strong>found in nature</strong>, the gate was commissioned in 1901 by the industrialist <strong>Hermenegild Miralles</strong> to provide access to his property, which is no longer there. Today it leads into a quiet street as one more feature of the neighbourhood, adding a touch of elegance and inspiration to the everyday life of its inhabitants.</p>
<h3>Genuine Gaudí</h3>
<p>The gate is an opening in the wall that surrounded the estate, only a part of which, made from stone and finished in <strong>white trencadís</strong>, remains, with a metal grille that looks like a <strong>reptile&#8217;s skin</strong>. With a large <strong>trefoil arch</strong> and overhanging canopy, the gate is crowned by a characteristic <strong>three dimensional cross</strong> made from wrought iron. At the side there is a smaller gate that still has the original grille.</p>
<p>The gate was restored in <strong>2000</strong> and a <strong>Gaudí statue</strong> was unveiled there. It was made by the sculptor <strong>Joaquim Camps</strong> as a tribute to this brilliant architect.</p>

<p>At the top of the <strong>Les Corts</strong> district is the Palau de Pedralbes, a building with medieval origins which was restored in the late 19th century and given to the Spanish royal family by <strong>Count Eusebi Güell</strong> in 1918 to thank them for his noble title, whereupon it was transformed into a <strong>Royal Palace </strong>between 1919 and 1931. Today it is the headquarters of the Secretariat General of the Union for the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The building was originally one of the <strong>17th century country houses </strong>built in the area. In 1862 it was purchased, along with a neighbouring country house, by Eusebi Güell, who had alterations carried out on his new estate, known as the <strong>Finca Güell</strong>. The country house was restored by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who also built the Caribbean-style palace and Neo-Gothic chapel, which are still there to this day.</p>
<h3>Gardens filled with surprises</h3>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong> was commissioned to build the walls and to design part of the gardens of which the famous <strong>Font d’Hèrcules</strong> fountain survives to this day, featuring a bust of Hercules on a plinth bearing the Catalan coat of arms and a wrought iron dragon that the water flows out of. The fountain, along with the Pavilions of the Finca Güell, forms part of the re-creation of the poem <strong><em>L’Atlàntida</em></strong>, by Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, that Gaudí so admired. The rest of the garden was designed by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, who designed the project that can still be seen to this day, with its <strong>decorative geometric layout </strong>featuring large Mediterranean trees, such as palm trees, cypress and pines, a pond and the three famous <strong>luminous fountains </strong>by Carles Buïgas. One outstanding feature is the statue of Queen Isabel II with her son Alfonso XII, the work of Agapit Vallmitjana, and another the pavilion of climbers, one of the <strong>first attempts at the typical Gaudiesque arch</strong>. The famous Palace garden, today populated with numerous <strong>exotic trees </strong>as well as the Mediterranean ones, is continuously visited by tourists and residents wishing to marvel at the <strong>beauty and variety </strong>of the natural space hidden behind its walls.</p>

<p>In 1972, the old train station belonging to the North of Spain Railway Company closed and was converted into today&#8217;s <strong>bus station</strong>. A Guàrdia Urbana police barracks was also located there, along with a <strong>municipal gym</strong> where, in 1992, the Olympic table-tennis tournament was held.</p>
<p>The original <strong>Neoclassical-style </strong>building dates from 1861<strong>.</strong> It was designed by Pere Andrés and the main feature that has been preserved is the south facade, which looks out onto the park. The magnificent <strong>glazed roof</strong>, as well as the facades on Carrer de Nàpols and the Carrer de Sardenya, are the work of Demetri Ribes and these were added later, in 1910. What stands out is the <strong>glass and ironwork</strong>, used a lot at that time in public buildings such as stations and markets.</p>
<h3>The park</h3>
<p>Sunny and peaceful, the park spreads over more than <strong>three hectares</strong> in which you can rest, jog, run, take some refreshment at the bar and play table tennis. There is also an area for dogs, a children&#8217;s recreation area and toilets, and it leads to the <strong>Fort Pienc</strong> football ground</p>
<p>Two large pieces of <strong>land art</strong> in the park stand out<em>:</em> <em>Spiral of Trees</em>, a spiral mosaic that goes into the ground, and <em>Fallen Sky</em>, a blue ceramic pyramid that stands in the grass. Both works were made using ceramic mosaic and are by the American artist <strong>Beverly Pepper</strong> as a tribute to Antoni Gaudí.</p>

<p>As a new feature of the Barceloneta area, the <strong>Torre del Rellotge</strong> was very important: it was <strong>one of the first lighthouses in the </strong>Mediterranean.

<p>Visible from many places in the port, the Torre del Rellotge is located on the famous <strong>Moll de Pescadors</strong> [ fisherman&#8217;s wharf], which also housed the passport office, the marine command headquarters and the health inspection post during the 18th century. While improvements were being made to Barcelona&#8217;s port, a decision was taken in 1904 to convert the defunct lighthouse into a clock tower, which it remains today.</p>
<h3>Long-term changes</h3>
<p>Architecturally, it is a <strong>pyramidal stone tower </strong>standing on a plinth. Later, in 1904, when it was converted into a clock tower, stucco was added along with the clock housing.</p>
<p>The former lighthouse, also has its own little story: it has the honour of being one of the <strong>geodesic points</strong> where the scientist <strong>Pierre François André Méchain</strong> took the measurements he used as the basis of the <strong>metric system. </strong></p>

            "#text": "<h3>Provocative shapes</h3>
<p>La Pedrera, or Casa Milà, owes its more popular name, to the controversy it provoked on its completion in <strong>1910</strong>. &#8220;The quarry&#8221; is an insulting name some locals came up with to mock the extravagant and gloomy appearance of its main facade. <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong> was commissioned to do it by the wealthy <strong>Milà family</strong>, who wanted to move to <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, like most comfortably-off bourgeois families at the start of the 20th century.</p>
<p>At that time, Gaudí was in his <strong>naturalist phase</strong> and at the height of his creative powers, so the house, inspired by the organic shapes of nature, has an <strong>undulating surface</strong> devoid of any volumetric rigidity. His innovation produced a whole that is a typical Gaudí work, where geometric lines are merely straight lines that form curves. Aside from the impressive <strong>decorated facades</strong>, another outstanding feature of La Pedrera is the roof terrace, with <strong>30 chimneys</strong> representing <strong>petrified warriors</strong> that make an open-air sculpture garden. The powerful religious symbolism Gaudí imbued the building with has also given rise to various interpretations.</p>
<h3>A space to enjoy Gaudí</h3>
<p>La Pedrera is currently owned by the <strong>Fundació Catalunya-La Pedrera</strong>. The foundation keeps <strong>the roof and the attic</strong> open to the public, and there is an <strong>exhibition on Gaudí</strong> and his work. Some of the flats are private and the main one has been turned into an <strong>exhibition hall</strong>. Exploring La Pedrera means entering Gaudí&#8217;s private universe, a world full of fantasy and impossible shapes that impresses every visitor.</p>

<p>Initially designed as the residence for the company’s manager, <strong>Nicolau Regúlez Chevalier</strong>, Casa de les Altures soon became a meeting point and a reception venue for the company. An idyllic space full of vegetation in the style of the <strong>gardens of Granada</strong> was designed around it, with orchards and nurseries, and water as another predominant feature.</p>
<h3>District Council offices</h3>
<p>When the City Council took over Casa de les Altures in 1984, the architect <strong>Víctor Argentí</strong> restored the building with a design that was awarded <strong>FAD Architecture Prize</strong> in 1990 for the best restoration project.</p>
<p>The house, which is named after the nearby <strong>water pumping stations</strong>, has been the <strong>Horta-Guinardó district headquarters</strong> since then.</p>

<p>The Masia de Can Fargues is a series of buildings from various eras whose land makes up all of what is now Guinardó Park. It had been an important<strong> country house</strong> until the 19th century, with fields, a barn, a water tank, a chapel, a labourers&#8217; house and the main residence with two floors and lofts. Other outstanding features are a cellar dating back to 1774 and a garden from a rather later period that surrounds the building. The Masia de Can Fargues is expected to house the <strong>Horta-Guinardó Municipal Music School</strong> in the 2016-2017 school year.</p>
<h3>Vestiges of the feudal past</h3>
<p>Dating back to an era when the feudal lords lived in fortified houses, this extant 12th century<strong> tower </strong>is currently protected as a Cultural Asset of National Interest. Square in shape and with a roof covered in Catalan tiles, it has been preserved practically intact. You can even see a room with wall paintings on the top floor.</p>

<p>On <strong>Passeig de Sant Gervasi</strong>, the Jardins de la Tamarita surround <strong>the old Noucentista house</strong> of the same name. The industrialist <strong>Alfredo Mata</strong> had it built in 1919 and today it houses the Blanquerna university. These gardens are among the first designed by the architect and landscape artist <strong>Nicolau M. Rubió i Tudurí</strong>.</p>
<p>They are full of <strong>decorative features</strong> that confirm their domestic origin and their layout invites you to take a <strong>quiet walk</strong> round them. With plenty of fountains, water jets and little ponds, there are lots of spots where you can take shelter to read or relax awhile.</p>
<h3>Natural contrasts</h3>
<p>The gardens are split into two, with a design that seeks to establish a contrast between a more orderly, <strong>classicist</strong> part, and another, once crossed by the Frare Blanc (White Friar) stream, that is more <strong>natural</strong>.</p>
<p>On the more classical side of the garden, <strong>French-style rose bushes</strong> combine with boxwood, and a belvedere with an allegorical architectural ensemble dedicated to he four contents. There is also a grassy area <strong>with a hundred-year-old oak</strong> that is 23 metres high and leads to the <strong>wilder part</strong> of the garden.</p>
<p>The little corners, decorative elements, magnificent vegetation and stone walls that surround the gardens create a <strong>feeling of protection and isolation</strong> that is very relaxing.</p>

<p>Between <strong>1966 and 1968, </strong>influenced by the style of the <strong>New York skyscrapers</strong>, the architect <strong>Josep Antoni Coderch</strong> engaged on an ambitious project: to construct the Trade buildings. Today, the four buildings that make up the complex, considered <strong>really surprising</strong> when they were first unveiled, form an essential part of the image of the area, in Avinguda Diagonal and <strong>Gran Via de Carles III.</strong></p>
<h3>Curved forms</h3>
<p>Designed in the shape of a <strong>lobed cross</strong>, the Trade buildings are adorned by <strong>curved facades</strong> and the striking <strong>curtain wall</strong>, which integrates the buildings perfectly into the site.</p>
<p>An icon of <strong>economic development</strong> during the period in which they were built, these outstanding service sector buildings in <strong>Les Corts district </strong>demonstrate that good things never go out of fashion. If anything, the <strong>architectural interest</strong> of this site has grown in the nearly half a centre since the buildings were completed.</p>

<p>Located right at the heart of <strong>Avinguda Diagonal</strong>, on the border between the districts of Les Corts and Sarrià-Sant Gervasi, we find Barcelona’s oldest <strong>shopping centre</strong>: L’Illa Diagonal, The centre covers an area of 35,000 square metres and has <strong>more than 170 shops</strong> and restaurants., The crowds have flocked to L’Illa Diagonal ever since it was inaugurated on 1 December 1993 and it has managed to attract customers not just from the surrounding area, but from all over the city. It has positioned itself as one of commercial spaces offering the highest quality of products and services.</p>
<p>Plans were first unveiled in 1990 for a centre on a 56,000 square metres<strong> urban site</strong> that occupied an entire block within the neighbourhood of les Corts. The size of the project led it to being called a <em>Supermanzana </em>or Superblock.</p>
<p>Designed by the architects <strong>Rafael Moneo and Manuel de Solà-Morales</strong>, the building has a peculiar style in the form of a <strong>horizontal skyscraper</strong> that seems to be lying on its side next to the Diagonal.</p>
<h3>Where you can find all that you need</h3>
<p>L’Illa Diagonal was the city’s first shopping centre to include a wide variety of <strong>shops and restaurants</strong>, as well as an hotel, offices and municipal facilities, and it quickly became a <strong>model of reference</strong> for all the new spaces of this kind that were subsequently inaugurated in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Following the <strong>latest reforms </strong>in 2006, L’Illa Diagonal increased its surface area by a further 4,000 square metres and a number of <strong>new shops</strong> and a large new hotel were opened.</p>
<p>There is nothing you will not find at L’Illa Diagonal, and the offer goes way beyond the shops and restaurants, since the complex also includes a sports complex, a <strong>conventions centre</strong>, a public park and even a discotheque with its own concert hall.</p>

<p>Structured round three large buildings with a very broad range of retail outlets, the <strong>Glòries Shopping Centre </strong>is spread over <strong>nearly 30,000 square metres</strong>. A small part of this space is taken up by offices, while the rest is dedicated to facilities for customers and visitors.</p>
<p>Created as part of the <strong>urban redevelopment for designing the Barcelona of the 1992 Olympic Games</strong>, the Shopping Centre forms part of the modern<strong> setting of the 22@ district</strong>. This is the result of the new architecture which characterised that period and continues to expand today. It has a partially open structure which makes it easy to get round and a pleasant place to spend the day and shop in.</p>
<h3>Developing a district</h3>
<p>The Glòries Shopping Centre <strong>opened in 1995</strong> and was remodelled in 2001 when the nearby Diagonal and Rambla del Poblenou were extended. Today the centre is immersed in another renovation process designed to promote fresh cuisine and take advantage of the latest redevelopment of the area to provide better links and access with the whole district.</p>

<p>More modest in size but just as pretty and central, Rambla de Catalunya is the<strong> extension of the Rambla</strong>. It starts in Plaça de Catalunya and threads its way to Avinguda de la Diagonal. Its pleasant boulevard is <strong>surround by lime trees</strong> that invite you to rest awhile on the benches placed along its length. The <strong>café terraces</strong> are another attraction it is difficult to avoid when you are taking a stroll. They still have that <i>savoir faire</i> of café-bars of old. You&#8217;ll come across some <strong>amazing works of architecture</strong> on your walk, such as Casa Fargas, a house by Enric Sagnier, Casa Serra, by the Modernista architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and Casa Juncosa, by Salvador Vinyals. Bonica i central, la rambla de Catalunya és la <strong>continuació de la Rambla</strong>: comença a la plaça de Catalunya i s’enfila fins a l’avinguda de la Diagonal. El seu agradable bulevard està <strong>rodejat d’arbres til·lers</strong> que conviden al repòs als bancs que hi ha col·locats al llarg de tota l’avinguda. Les <strong>terrasses dels cafès</strong> són un altre atractiu difícilment eludible quan s’hi passeja: mantenen el <i>savoir faire</i> dels cafès d’abans. El passejant toparà amb <strong>espectaculars obres arquitectòniques</strong> com la Casa Fargas, d’Enric Sagnier; la Casa Serra, del modernista Josep Puig i Cadafalch, o la Casa Juncosa, de Salvador Vinyals. What&#8217;s more, you can also enjoy Josep Granyer&#8217;s sculptures: <i>Meditación</i> and <i>Coqueta</i>; popularly known as <strong>El Toro Assegut</strong> (the Seated Bull) and <strong>La Girafa Coqueta</strong> (the Flirtatious Giraffe).</p>
<h3>Local quality commerce</h3>
<p>Its family businesses and age-old shops have always given the Rambla de Catalunya a highly individual, local and charming touch that blends perfectly with the large commercial brands that have arrived.</p>
<p>Needless to say, you&#8217;ll also see lots of fashion shop among these unmissable buildings.</p>

<p>Parc de la Trinitat, which is semicircular in shape, is dominated by a hill with a canal at its foot. As you enter the park, you will find a <strong>multipurpose amphitheatre</strong> on the left of the main entrance, which ends where the canal begins. Stairs give access to the large recreation area you will see once you have passed the sports courts and <strong>picnic and barbecue</strong> area. There are two tennis courts, a volleyball court, a basketball court and a mini football court. If you go beyond the sports area, you will see <strong>2,400 square metres of urban allotments</strong>: 61 plots of land cultivated by the neighbourhood&#8217;s senior citizens. Look right and you will see the most landscaped part, which you can observe from the path at the top of the park that functions as a balcony. Two sculptural sets are also integrated into the park&#8217;s landscape:Josep Ros’ <em>Runaway horses</em> and Rafael Bartolozzi’s <em>Woman bathing</em>.</p>
<h3>A great place for racing model cars</h3>
<p>Parc de la Trinitat is a great place for model car and boat enthusiasts. The lake is often <strong>full of boats</strong> and there are also <strong>tracks for model car racing</strong>, run by the Sant Andreu Model Enthusiasts&#8217; Association.</p>

<p>The Palau de Mar started life in 1890 as the General Port Warehouse, for <strong>storing the goods</strong> that arrived in Barcelona by sea. This was renovated and transformed for the 1992 Olympics and today houses the <strong>Museu d’Història de Catalunya</strong>, the Centre of Contemporary History and the Catalan Department of Social Welfare, as well as various offices, restaurants and cafeterias.</p>
<p>Among other things, the 1992 renovation gave the building an upper floor that provided access to the roof terrace, which has become a big hit with locals and tourists alike for the <strong>magnificent vistas</strong> it offers of the port, the sea, Montjuïc and the city in general.</p>
<h3>A stroll through history</h3>
<p>The Museu d’Història de Catalunya, which opened in 1996, preserves and exhibits items that recount the story of life in Catalonia, from the dawn of prehistory to the present day. A visit to the history museum&#8217;s rooms takes you on a real <strong>journey through time</strong> and lets you see all the facets of this many-sided country: from Roman to industrial Catalonia, from the invaded to the invading Catalonia, from a time of great splendour to the painful years following the Civil War, from life in the countryside to life in the cities, and from the past to the present.</p>
<p>Also in the Palau, the <strong>Centre d’Història Contemporània</strong> completes the museum dedicated to the study and dissemination of history, with a view of the 20th century that is often very different to the one that prevailed during the Franco period.</p>
<p>Just outside the museum building, the jetties and the boats add to this delightful visit to the <strong>Barcelona waterfront</strong>.</p>

<p>Built in 1905 by the Modernista architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner, who also built the Palau de la Música Catalana, Casa Lleó Morera was commissioned by the Morera family to remodel the former Casa Rocamora dating from 1864.It is located on the south corner of the<strong> <em>illa de la discòrdia</em></strong>, an Eixample blockknown by this name for holding some of the most representative and emblematic Modernista houses in Passeig de Gràcia, namely Casa Amatller by Puig Cadafalch and Casa Batlló by Antoni Gaudí, which compete together for their magnificence.<br /> Described by some as a small-scale Palau de la Música ,Casa Lleó Morera has great architectural value owing to the number of<strong> craftsman </strong>who worked on it. Out of all the people who contributed their talent in remodelling the building, the sculptors Eusebi Arnau and Alfons Jujol, the glaziers Rigalt and Granell, and the mosaic craftsmen Mario Maragliano and Lluís Bru stand out.</p>
<h3>Naturalist inspiration</h3>
<p>The house belonged to the Morera family for three generations, which made it possible to preserve the majority of the most characteristic features of the building, such as the delicate <strong>ornamental features</strong> inspired by <strong>nature</strong> and made in various materials, as usually occurred in the <strong>Modernista style.</strong> Having been sold and passed through many hands,it became the property of the Núñez i Navarro company in 2003 and they drew up a <strong>restoration and preservation plan</strong> for the building. Today, excellent <strong>guided tours</strong> are organised which take you inside one of the <strong>icons of Modernisme </strong>on a journey through history, architecture and art.</p>

Its interior features a life sized <strong>fresco mural</strong> which represents the birth of the shield of Catalonia, with Guifré el Pilós painting the four bars of blood from the mortal wound. You can also visit the ancient cave where, according to the legend, the <strong>bandit Joan de Serrallonga</strong> hid, and it is believed that it connected with Collserola. The farmhouse, known as Can Figuerola, also preserves original furniture of the time, as well as ceramic objects and some <strong>pieces of religious art</strong>.</p>
<h3>A farmhouse of the 15th century</h3>
<p>The farmhouse which today houses the museum, restored by the Palmero family, preserves the <strong>stone facade</strong> with windows of Gothic inspiration. Located beside apartment blocks in Carrer de Judea, it stands out as a reminder of a <strong>rural past</strong>.</p>

It also offers advice and hires out equipment.</p>
<h3>The pleasure of taking to the sea</h3>
<p>Sailing is much more than a sport: it is a way of understanding and enjoying the sea without forgetting the safety measures it demands. That&#8217;s why the school&#8217;s teachers are <strong>qualified instructors</strong> trained to teach sailing at every level, from the most basic to competitive sailing, while following the standards set by the Catalan Sailing School.Besides teaching sailing, the centre also offers courses on yachting, <strong>windsurf</strong> and <strong>scuba diving</strong>.</p>

<p>Officially opened in<strong> 1929 for the Barcelona International Exposition</strong>, Estació de França is an outstanding monumental building on Avinguda del Marquès de l’Argentera, in the Born neighbourhood.  Designed by the engineer Andreu Muntaner and the architect Pedro Muguruza, the building was a joint creation and features a dual metal canopy with windows that allows a dramatic play of natural light on the 12 tracks that make it up. It is one of the most important examples of Modernista iron architecture in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Another beautiful feature is the <strong>Noucentista foyer</strong> with three enormous domes, designed by the architect Duran i Reynals, to extend the building. The presence of <strong>high quality materials</strong> such as marble and bronze, both in the noble foyer and the rest of the station, enhance the spectacular <strong>appearance and distinction of the station</strong>, which is often compared to Orsay Station in Paris.</p>
<h3>A versatile space</h3>
<p>After some thorough remodelling, the station reopened in 1992, to mark with the Barcelona Olympic Games. The station was previously known as Barcelona-Término; long-distance trains took a back seat when it became exclusively dedicated to <strong>middle-distance journeys</strong>. Recent years have seen a rise in the station&#8217;s <strong> cultural importance</strong>. It now plays host to events such as the Comics Fair, concerts, exhibitions and even trade fairs and markets, such as the Lost &amp; Found second-hand market.</p>

Those responsible for the original building were the architects <strong>Josep Lluís Sert and Luis Lacasa</strong>, and it was an architectural landmark in its day, due to its <strong>rationalist style</strong>, very much in line with the avant-garde of the era. It was also a <strong>hugely symbolic building</strong>, very much against the Civil War being waged in Spain at that time. In 1992, the architects Espinet i Ubach created an exact replica, using the same precarious materials that were used in the 1930s, to produce a building just like the original: a <strong>large empty container</strong>, almost without walls, through which a route was marked. The compartments close by means of <strong>metal structures</strong>, with glass on the first floor and fibre-cement on the second.</p>
<p><strong>Art and the anti-war movement. </strong>It should be pointed out that, as an anti-war and anti-fascist symbol, the original pavilion displayed some important artworks inside, such as <strong>Pablo Picasso&#8217;s</strong> <em>Guernica</em>, a 1:1 scale replica of which can be found in the current pavilion; <em>The Harvester</em> by <strong>Joan Miró</strong>; and the <em>Font de Mercuri</em> by <strong>Alexander Calder</strong>, which is now on display in the Fundació Joan Miró.</p>
<p>This pavilion is currently home to the Centre for International Historical Studies and the Pavelló de la República Library, which houses a collection of international importance on the Second Republic, the Spanish Civil War, Francoism, exile and the transition to democracy in Spain and Catalonia.</p>

They are the work of artist <strong>Claes Oldenburg</strong> and his wife, the art critic and restorer <strong>Coosje van Bruggen</strong>. This couple, of Scandinavian and Dutch origins respectively, are benchmarks of American pop culture, especially renowned for pieces that reproduce essential objects in giant sizes.</p>
<p>Claes Oldenburg is one of the <strong>pioneers of <i>pop art</i></strong>. He opened a shop in New York in 1962 that sold <strong>plaster representations</strong> of hamburgers and cakes, following the trend of converting consumer products into works of art.</p>
<h3>Dynamism and character</h3>
<p>The sculpture, also known by its English name of <i>Match Cover,</i> is located at the intersection of Avinguda del Cardenal Vidal i Barraquer with Carrer del Pare Mariana, in Vall d’Hebron Park. It is an attractive, joyful and fun work, with great dynamism, and it brings character to its surroundings. Opposite is the <strong>Spanish Republic Pavilion</strong>, which was reconstructed in 1992 following the original model of <strong>Josep Lluís Sert</strong> at the 1937 Universal Exhibition in Paris.</p>

<p>En plena febre urbanística de les <strong>Olimpíades del 1992</strong>, l’arquitecte anglès <strong>Norman Foster</strong> va construir en un cim de la <strong>serralada de Collserola</strong>, i amb l’objectiu d’assegurar les<strong> telecomunicacions</strong> de la ciutat, la Torre de Collserola, un <strong>equipament molt avançat</strong> pel seu temps. Des d’aleshores i fins avui dia, és la que realitza la majoria d’enllaços audiovisuals de l’àrea metropolitana i la província.</p>
<p>La torre, de 288 metres d’alçada totals i tretze pisos, està feta amb un <strong>esperit d’innovació</strong>, ja que segons el mateix arquitecte havia de ser un <strong>nou símbol</strong> per a la ciutat, marcant un abans i un després de les Olimpíades. El seu <strong>disseny futurista </strong>es pot observar des de molts punts de la ciutat com una icona més.</p>
<h3>Vistes infinites</h3>
<p>Situada al turó de la Viana, la Torre de Collserola té un mirador obert al públic situat a 150 metres d’alçada i a 560 metres d’altitud sobre el nivell del mar. Go up there and you will have some amazing views of the Collserola range, the city, its metropolitan area and much more besides because, on a clear day, you can see the outline of Cadí-Moixeró, in the Pre-Pyreneean mountain range, and the Tramuntana range on the island of Mallorca.</p>
<p>Com a curiositat, cal destacar que la Torre de Collserola compta amb un <strong>servei de càtering</strong> per a empreses que permet celebrar al seu interior qualsevol tipus d’esdeveniment.</p>

<h3>The Olympic Ring gym</h3>
<p>The pools are currently a <strong>municipally owned centre</strong> run by a private company. They are open throughout the year and their facilities include <strong>supervised activity rooms and padel courts</strong>. The centre also has synchronised swimming and water polo teams.</p>

<p>In Parc de la Vall d’Hebron in the north of Barcelona, there is a very surprising museum that helps us get to know more about the history of transport in Barcelona. It is the <strong>Museu de Carruatges</strong>, a horse-drawn carriage museum with a collection of goods wagons and passenger coaches. The carts and wagons include some that transported stone from the quarries to the worksites and others used for cleaning the city&#8217;s streets. Among the coaches is an elegant Berlin model.</p>
<h3>A journey back to the past</h3>
<p>This private collection consists of <strong>46 shining exhibits</strong> collected over the years by the <strong>Piera family</strong>, traditionally involved in the road haulage business. It also includes <strong>horse-riding</strong> items from the 19th and 20th centuries, coachmen&#8217;s clothing, reigns, bridles and other accessories. In all, more than <strong>600 pieces</strong> from various periods that tell the story of a means of transport and, by extension, a <strong>way of life</strong> for Barcelona folk back then.</p>
<p>Today the collection is managed by <strong>Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas, SA</strong>, a company that was involved in street cleaning and refuse collection at the start of the 20th century.</p>

<p>The <strong>Llars Anna Gironella de Mundet</strong>, popularly known as Llars Mundet, were set up in 1954, when the businessman <strong>Artur Mundet</strong> took charge of building a place to care for orphans, elderly people, the sick and others in need in the Horta-Guinardó district, to replace the old <strong>Casa de la Caritat </strong>, which had served that purpose in Raval up to that point, but had become outdated.</p>
<p>With its tradition of <strong>public service</strong>, the current Llars Mundet complex comes under the <strong>Barcelona Provincial Council</strong> and includes <strong>care centres for the elderly</strong>, a sports facility run by the <strong>Catalan Federation for the Mentally Ill</strong> and a school service, as well as the Psychology and Pedagogy faculties of the <strong>University of Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>Multipurpose site</h3>
<p>Surrounded by <strong>&nbsp;greenery and nature</strong>, the site covers <strong>14 hectares</strong>, six of them in woodland, with the typical flora of the <strong>Collserola range</strong>. Thousands of people walk round it every day: <strong>university students</strong>, children going to school, old people and others who just want to visit one of the largest and most complete sites in the city that has been <strong>entirely</strong> <strong>devoted</strong> <strong>&nbsp;to its citizens</strong> for <strong>more than 50 years</strong>.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A show of strength</h3>
<p>Antoni Gaudí took over the project when the foundations of the building had already been laid. For this reason, he decided to follow the original square-shaped structure, which he built like a castle in reference to one of St. Teresa&#8217;s writings, <em>The Interior Castle</em>. Unlike other commissions, Gaudí had to stick to a relatively low budget, which is why he <strong>used brick</strong> instead of stone, and this also explains the plaster walls of the interior and the restraint shown in the decoration. Although the order&#8217;s vow of poverty prevented the construction of an ostentatious building, the result was a <strong>gigantic building</strong> with more than a few decorative elements, which went quite a bit beyond modesty. Gaudi&#8217;s work was finished in 1889, and the building has been on the <strong>heritage list</strong> since 1969. </p>
<h3>Gaudí&#8217;s personal stamp</h3>
<p>The most prolific architect of Catalan <em>Modernisme</em> is famous for his highly personal architectural solutions as well as the symbolism of the elements he used. The Col·legi de les Teresianes is no exception, and this can be seen in the use of <strong>parabolic arches</strong> and the religious decorations on the <br /> building’s exterior. The <strong>spiral columns</strong>, wrought ironwork and <strong>four-armed crosses</strong> (three dimensional crosses) are also the personal stamp of the Catalan genius.</p>

These workshops, where locks and security items were manufactured, formed a large brick compound with metal structures. The most unique part of the compound was its natural lighting system, using skylights.</p>
<h3>An unusual man</h3>
<p>Pere Manyach, who came from a rich family of industrialists, led a truly fascinating life. A lover of the <strong>cultural movement </strong>of his time, he was Picasso&#8217;s first art dealer and a patron of young Catalan artists such as Jujol. He flirted with the <strong>anarchist ideas</strong> of his day, which caused him a few problems, and he was a friend of Antoni Gaudí&#8217;s too.</p>

<p>With their ornamental fountains, rows of enormous trees, numerous sculptures and plants from <strong>French landscape gardening</strong> of the 20th century, it is no surprise that the Joan Maragall Gardens are considered to be among the most elegant in Barcelona. What&#8217;s more, they surround the Neoclassical <strong>Albéniz</strong> Palace, the official residence of the royal family on their visits to Barcelona.</p>
<p> Designed by Jean-Claude-Nicolas&nbsp;Forestier in 1929 for the Barcelona International Exposition, the Joan Maragall Gardens are a place of serenity where silence and the gentle bubbling water are the main sounds. The extensive lawns with typical Mediterranean trees such as olives and holm oaks are interspersed with more exotic species such as Cycas revoluta. The granite sand paths enable us to explore the garden and its different corners. At the main entrance, a large avenue of magnolias featuring a large pond with water jets in the centre lead to the foot of the hill in front of the palace. Above, a semicircular square, surrounded by Cyprus trees and dominated by the <strong>Statue of Serena</strong> is the antechamber to a small amphitheatre.</p>
<h3>Music and poetry</h3>
<p>The palace, also built in 1929 by Joan Moya,is a neo-classical style building of great architectural value that was remodelled and refurbished in 1970, giving it the appearance it has today. The palace is named after the musician Isaac Albéniz, as, for a while, the option of establishing the Museum of Music there was considered, although in the end this did not happen. Also in 1970, the gardens were extended and became known as the Joan Maragall Gardens, in honour of the <strong>Catalan poet</strong>.</p>
<p> Walking through these <strong>royal parks</strong>, which are not always open to the public, is to enter another world, an experience that enables visitors to observe what the man idealised as a <strong>paradise on earth</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Barna Centre</strong> lies in the heart of the old city, popularly known as the <strong>Barri Gòtic </strong>, seeing as it preserves the imposing architecture of medieval Barcelona and is full of palaces and churches, such as the cathedral, the <strong>Santa Àgata</strong> and <strong>Santa Llúcia</strong> chapels, the <strong>Casa</strong> <strong>Padellàs</strong>, the <strong>Palau Reial</strong>, <strong>Palau de la Generalitat</strong>, <strong>Palau</strong> <strong>Episcopal</strong> and the <strong>Palau Municipal</strong>, the City Hall. It also includes the city&#8217;s old Jewish quarter, <strong>El</strong> <strong>Call</strong>, a tangle of small streets full of emotion and silence, once the focus of intense commercial activity among Barcelona&#8217;s Jewish community during the <strong>Middle Ages</strong>. This magnificent medieval heritage continues side by side with the remains of old <strong>Barcino</strong>, Roman Barcelona: these include the Roman wall, the pagan temple to Augustus, the Via Sepulcral Romana necropolis at <strong>Plaça de la Vila de Madrid</strong>.</p>
<h3>Barna Centre: commercial spirit</h3>
<p>You will find a hive of commercial activity amid the privileged urban landscape that is the Gòtic neighbourhood. The area receives more than <strong>51 million visitors each year</strong>. And that is no mean feat: the commercial activity here is extraordinary in both its quantity and diversity. This area has almost <strong>sixty thousand square metres of commercial space </strong>dedicated to every kind of product imaginable, with several truly unique shops. The big brand names can be found side by side with local-designer footwear and clothes shops as well as unique and specialist stores, many of which go back a hundred years, living monuments to previous eras: candle merchants, such as <strong>Abella</strong>, on <strong>C/ Boters</strong>, and <strong>Subirà</strong> and <strong>Codina</strong>, on <strong>Baixada de la Llibreteria</strong>; full-range knife shops such as the ones in <strong>Plaça del Pi</strong> and C/ <strong> Call </strong>and C/ <strong>Ferran</strong>; boutiques dedicated to selling <i>espardenyes</i> [traditional rope-soled shoes], such as <strong>Manual Alpargatera</strong>, where this typical Catalan footwear is still made by hand; shops specialising in prints and religious items, gloves and hats, such as the glovers <strong>Guanteria Alonso</strong>, on <strong>C/ Santa Anna</strong> and the milliners <strong>Mil</strong>, on <strong>C/ Fontanella</strong> and <strong>Obach</strong>, on <strong>C/ Call</strong>. There are also shops that specialise in board games, offering handmade chess boards that are true works of art, as well as a whole host of jewellers. The Barna Centre includes specialists in <strong>antiques, coins, stamps, ceramics </strong>and<strong> crafts</strong>. Many of the businesses in the neighbourhood are also craft food shops, such as <strong>Caelum</strong>, a heavenly establishment for purchasing &#8220;monastic&#8221; cakes and biscuits, stores selling handmade<strong> <i>torrons</i></strong> [a kind of Catalan nougat] and the classic <strong><i>granja</i></strong> cafes on <strong>C/ Petritxol</strong>, one of the favourite places the locals go to for breakfasting or snacking on hot chocolate and cake. Tiny in size but immense in its beauty, this side-street is also houses the city&#8217;s oldest art galleries.</p>

<p>Very close to the <strong>Laberint d’Horta</strong> are the Palau de les Heures gardens, not as famous as the former but equalling it in beauty. Built along with the palace at the end of the 19th century by the architect <strong>August Font i Carreras</strong>, commissioned by the businessman Josep Gallart Forgas, the gardens feature tall palm trees along with other trees such as magnolias, acacias, cedars, orange trees, holm oaks, etc. Experiencing the full splendour of the gardens in springtime is a <strong>delight to the senses</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The French and Italian Renaissance-style garden</strong>, designed by Adrià Piera, is structured around three terraces, the highest being home to the palace and the first garden. The second and third &#8211; which is the largest &#8211; are the ones with the greatest <strong>landscape value</strong>, thanks to their leafy trees and numerous flower beds.</p>
<p><strong>A hidden palace</strong> From the entrance to the park, the palace can be seen in the distance, lost among the palm trees, with two stairways that lead down to the garden. Built in the style of a French <strong><em>château</em></strong>, it has four cylindrical towers with conical peaks. Standing guard over the facade of the building are a group of sculptures which are an allegory of <strong>Les Heures</strong> by Josep Campeny.</p>
<p>Official residence of the Gallart family until the Civil War, for a while the palace was home to the president of the Generalitat, <strong>Lluís Companys</strong>. Later it became the property of <strong>Barcelona Provincial Council</strong> for public use, before becoming the <strong>Bosch i Gimpera</strong> University Foundation, linked to the University of Barcelona.</p>

<p>Situated in the area that was once home to a quarry, at the foot of <strong>Montjuïc</strong> Castle, these gardens designed by Joaquim Maria Casamor were opened in 1970 and are one of the three parks in Montjuïc dedicated to Catalan poets, along with the Joan Maragall and Costa i Llobera Gardens. Covering almost five hectares, and boasting an exceptional array of colours, you find flower-beds of irises, tulips, narcissus flowers and hyacinths, among other flowers, along with eucalyptus, poplars, magnolias. Their flowering seasons are March to April and from the end of July to early September and with each season the flowers change colour and have a different charm, depending on the time of year.</p>
<h3>Water features</h3>
<p>The ponds at the top of the gardens, divided and connected by a stairway, are the great protagonists. The water runs down from a small, <strong>elongated pond</strong>, and a <strong>wooden bridge </strong>completes this delicate corner where the entrance to the park is located. At the bottom of the stairway is a lake and an <strong>enormous meadow </strong>scattered with large trees, that joins these gardens to those of Joan Brossa. There are also two <strong>female sculptures </strong>in the gardens: the <em>Noia dels Lliris</em> by Ramon Sabi and <em>Maternitat </em>by Sebastià Badia. The first, a tribute to Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, is situated close to the lake and the second is next to the gardeners&#8217; hut, beneath <strong>a large maritime pine</strong>.This garden is a perfect place to go for a <strong>walk and rest</strong>, to discover the different plants and enjoy the various colours of the flowers at different times of the year.</p>

<p>Bar Marsella is associated with <strong>Hemingway</strong>, maybe because he was the drinking establishment&#8217;s most famous patron, but it was also the haunt of other artists such as <strong>Dalí, Picasso and Gaudí</strong>. The bar has been a success throughout its two-hundred-year history. It is located at the junction between <strong>Sant Pau and Sant Ramon streets</strong>, in the heart of the Raval neighbourhood and still retains its original bohemian spirit: period lights still hang from its ceiling, there are age-old bottles covered with a solid layer of dust and cobwebs are draped everywhere. Entering is such as <strong>stepping back in time</strong>. December 2013 saw the Marsella&#8217;s future at stake: the building&#8217;s owners wanted the bar manager to leave the premises, but Barcelona City Council used its right to first refusal, buying the property and saving the manager&#8217;s job.</p>
<h3>The absinthe bar</h3>
<p>Still today you can order this <strong>drink that bears some resemblance to anise </strong>but with a super-high alcohol content. The drink was particularly <strong>popular</strong> among artists <strong>in Paris at the end of the 19th century</strong>: it seems to have been an aid to inspiration. Drinking it requires a special ritual: it is served with a bottle of water, a sugar lump and a fork. Only the most audacious know why.</p>

<p>In the middle of Barcelona&#8217;s metropolitan area, extending along four of the city&#8217;s districts, rises the Collserola range, a <strong>typically Mediterranean forest </strong>of pines, oaks and holm oaks, together with a great <strong>diversity of fauna</strong>, just a stone&#8217;s throw from the built-up area. Take a trip into this natural world that can easily be reached by train, and even bus, from the city. A special natural area for Barcelona&#8217;s residents, with more than <strong>8,000 hectares of greenery</strong> where you can walk, cycle on different routes, look out from viewpoints, visit historic places and escape from the city without having to move too far at al.I It is amazing how, from one end to the other, you can enjoy wide-open vistas from viewpoints on both sides: from <strong>Torre Baró</strong>, in Nou Barris, it seems like you can almost touch the mountain of Montseny, and from <strong>Finestrelles hill</strong> in Les Corts, the panorama opens on one side over the city to Maresme and, on the other, from the airport to Martorell, looking out over the whole Llobregat.</p>
<p>The Collserola range <strong>natural park</strong> has been a <strong>protected area</strong> since 1987, and nine municipalities are involved in preserving it and educating people about it. Going to the <strong>Les Planes picnic area</strong>, taking a trip along Passeig de les Aigües or delving into the woods to look for asparagus are typical snapshots of daily life in Barcelona.</p>
<h3>City and nature merge</h3>
<p>Even though it is predominantly <strong>virgin territory</strong>, the Collserola range has small <strong>residential centres</strong> that belong to the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district and which make up the only real residential zones in this part of Collserola: just above Passeig de les Aigües is <strong>Vallvidrera</strong>, followed a little further in, on a slope, by the village of <strong>Les Planes</strong> and, finally, there is the urban development around <strong>Tibidabo</strong>, the smallest in this part of the mountains. Collserola is present in other neighbourhoods in Barcelona, too, like <strong>Valcarca i els Penitents</strong> (in the Gràcia district) and <strong>Sant Genís dels Agudells</strong>, <strong>Montbau</strong> and <strong>Horta</strong> (in the Horta-Guinardó district).</p>
<p>Collserola means escaping so quickly and directly from the city that the asphalt under your feet changes to soil almost before you notice. A stone&#8217;s throw from Barcelona, contact with nature, the forests and the animals is easy.</p>

<h3>Petra de San José</h3>
<p><strong>Blessed Petra de San José</strong>, founder of the congregation and promoter of this and many other centres all over the country, died in the chapel of the sanctuary in 1906. Originally from Malaga, this nun dedicated her life to the building of hospitals and homes for the poor, always respecting the strict guidelines prescribed by her congregation. Today, the complex includes a centre that belongs to the Federation of Institutions offering Care and Education to Children and Adolescents (<strong>FEDAIA</strong>).</p>

<p>Plaça de Llucmajor is at the junction formed by Passeig de Valldaura, Passeig de Verdum and Via Júlia. It is one of the <strong>nerve centres</strong> of the Nou Barris district. The square was remodelled in 1990, with a design that included a <strong>central roundabout</strong> and a large, abstract steel sculpture with a specific purpose: to create, at last, a place for the <em>La República</em> sculpture.</p>
<p>In the centre a large monolith accompanies a 4.5 m <strong>bronze statue</strong> called <strong><em>Flame,</em></strong> created by the sculptor Josep Viladomat. The nude figure of a tall young woman with one arm raised and a laurel branch in her hand, is a symbol of freedom and the future. At the base is a <strong>medallion</strong> by the sculptor Joan Pié with the face in <strong>relief of Pi i Margall</strong>, who became president of the First Spanish Republic in 1873.</p>
<h3>Historical memory</h3>
<p>Both pieces have a long history that goes back to before they were even made. In 1915 the City Council decided to draw up plans for a <strong>sculptural ensemble</strong> dedicated to the Republic and in honour of Pi i Margall to be placed near the obelisk at the centre of the square that was then called Plaça del <strong>Cinc d’Ors</strong>, at the Passeig de Gràcia-Avinguda Diagonal crossroads. But the sculpture did not materialise until the arrival of the <strong>Second Republic</strong>. The president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Lluís Companys, unveiled it on 12 April 1936 but, after the <strong>Civil War</strong>, the Franco regime ordered the statue and the medallion to be removed and destroyed. Thanks to the architects Adolf Florensa and Joaquim Vilaseca, however, they were hidden in a municipal garage and survived. They stayed there until the restoration of <strong>democracy</strong>, when they began their new life. First they were put in Plaça de Sóller, before being installed in Plaça de Llucmajor, their <strong>definitive location</strong>, tailored to a neighbourhood and people that have adopted them and turned them into a symbol.</p>

<p>The <strong>Spanish Civil War Historical Society</strong> officially unveiled the monument by the <strong>American sculptor Roy Shifrin</strong> on 28 October 1988, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the brigade&#8217;s departure from Spain. It is a work in bronze which represents the naked torso of David with a shield in his hand, on a concrete pedestal. The figure of Goliath is at the base. Tribute has been paid to the brigade every last Saturday in October ever since.</p>
<h3>The abraham lincoln battalion</h3>
<p>A plaque at the foot of the monument contains excerpts from the farewell speech to the brigade given by the Communist leader <strong>Dolores Ibárruri, <i>La Pasionaria</i></strong>, a huge event held in Barcelona with a parade of the international volunteer soldiers who had fought <strong>against Fascism</strong>, before they left the country. The sculpture was funded by the association which runs the <strong>Abraham Lincoln Batallion</strong>, which is made up by American soldiers and the Spanish Civil War Historical Society.</p>

<h3>Uniting the neighbourhood</h3>
<p>Through the Barnavasi Traders Association, the Sant Gervasi Shopping Hub promotes <strong>revitalisation campaigns </strong>that benefit traders, local residents and visitors. Many of the promotional, charitable and cultural events take place in front of the iconic Sant Gervasi Market, which is a vital part of neighbourhood life. Others, like the annual <strong>street commerce </strong>festival, fill Carrer de Muntaner with a variety of colourful stalls.</p>

<p>Now one of <strong>Nou Barris</strong> most iconic symbols, Torre Baró Castle stands between the Roquetes and Torre Baró neighbourhoods. The name &#8220;Torre Baró&#8221; actually comes from another &#8220;torre&#8221; that no longer exists and stood on the site of the metro station, a mansion that belonged to Baron Pinós, the <strong>Baró de Pinós</strong> in Catalan, until it was destroyed in 1714 during the War of the Spanish Succession.</p>
<h3>A privileged viewpoint</h3>
<p>Despite its medieval appearance, the <strong>Castell de Torre Baró</strong>, which dominates the neighbourhood, was built at the start of the 20th century. It was part of a plan to create a hotel at the centre of an <strong>urban development in the area</strong>, but the plan did not work and was abandoned before the building work was finished. Finally, in 1989, it was restored and declared a <strong>historical heritage</strong> site by Barcelona City Council, with a magnificent viewpoint being built round it.</p>
<p>Today it is a <strong>Parc de Collserola</strong> environmental education and information point. Among other activities, it offers guided tours of the castle, itineraries for discovering the surrounding area and education workshops for all ages. It is one of the best viewing points in Barcelona, offering visitors the chance to look out over Nou Barris, Horta, Sant Andreu, Sant Martí and, beyond them, <strong>the River Besòs</strong> and the foothills of Collserola, with the towns of Santa Coloma, Sant Adrià and Badalona.</p>

<p>“Marbella” is the name given to land reclaimed from the sea, today the site of the <strong>fisherman&#8217;s neighbourhood of Barceloneta</strong>. This meaning explains the names of two nearby beaches next to each other, Mar Bella and Nova Mar Bella.</p>
<p>Nova Mar Bella is the favourite beach of <strong>women</strong>(who make up 60 per cent of its users) and <strong>young people</strong>. Along with Mar Bella, it is one of the beaches most frequented by <strong>Sant Martí residents</strong>, probably because it is quiet.</p>
<h3>Easily accessible for everyone</h3>
<p>This is an ideal beach for <strong>people with disabilities or reduced mobility</strong> thanks to the wooden boards that cross the sand to the sea. There is also a team of volunteers who can help people into the water, if necessary, with a hoist. But you need to request this service beforehand at the information centre on the beach and be accompanied by an adult.</p>

<p>This 512 m beach has a <strong>large and loyal public</strong> and it is one of the favourite beaches of Sant Martí residents.</p>
<h3>Play or do some sport</h3>
<p>The beach also has a children&#8217;s play area and a volleyball court near the Bac de Roda breakwater. Other amenities include a basketball basket, an area for skateboarding and a table-tennis table. At the west end there is a <strong>base nàutica</strong> for sailing and rowing.</p>
<p>This beach came out of the redevelopment of the Barcelona coastline for the <strong>Olympic Games</strong>. Before then, at the start of the 20th century, this part of the coastline had the <strong>Banys de la Mar Bella</strong>, a popular bathing option for Barcelona folk in the past before these baths went into decline in the middle of the last century following a storm.</p>

<p>Early in the 19th century, the utopian socialist Étienne Cabet imagined an island, Icaria, recalling the Greek island of the same name and the flight of Icarus in Greek mythology, where machines would do the laborious tasks instead of men. Later the urban planner Ildefons Cerdà, who realised his own utopian city dream in the Barcelona Eixample, applied this suggestive name to the old path that led to the Poblenou cemetery, then surrounded by factories.</p>
<p>For decades the area now taken up by Nova Icària Beach was known as <strong>Somorrostro</strong>, a shantytown housing thousands of families in terrible conditions. When that disappeared at the end of the 1960s, the area was left abandoned until Cerdà&#8217;s dream came true with the <strong>Barcelona &#8217;92 Olympics</strong>. Nova Icària was reclaimed and turned into one of the beaches that locals prize the most.</p>
<h3>Fun and quiet</h3>
<p>Today Nova Icària is one of the <strong>quietest</strong> beaches in Barcelona, along with Bogatell. So its users tend to stay longer than those of the other beaches.</p>
<p>In the middle of the city&#8217;s shoreline and with the Port Olímpic&#8217;s <strong>twin towers</strong> as a backdrop, it is 415 metres long and has one of the best set of leisure facilities of all Barcelona&#8217;s beaches. You can enjoy a quiet day there at the <strong>table-tennis tables </strong>next to the Bogatell breakwater, or the <strong>volleyball courts</strong> next to the Olympic Port.</p>

<p>Going for a swim in the <strong>open sea</strong> was a real adventure for Barcelona people a century ago and not always looked on favourably. Consequently, the well-off opted to spend the day at the <strong>baths </strong>and <strong>sports clubs</strong> that sprang up at that time.</p>
<p>The swimming baths, which have long gone, had pools and solariums. They were private and reserved for wealthy families. On the Sant Sebastià and Barceloneta beaches were some very popular swimming baths, among them the Senyora Tona, Sant Sebastià, Orientals and Neptú baths. They all offered users the chance to <strong>enjoy the water</strong> in an <em>appropriate</em> manner, as social conventions regarding bathing in public at that time were very restrictive. Despite that, Sant Sebastià Beach saw the first <strong>mixed bathing area</strong>, where men and women could swim together.</p>
<p>It was here that the city&#8217;s two most important swimming clubs were founded as well. They are still going but they have merged to form the <strong>Club Natació Atlètic-Barceloneta</strong>, a centre that has been a pioneer in water sports for a century.</p>
<h3>21st century beaches</h3>
<p>In the run-up to the 1992 Olympic Games, the beaches were cleaned up and modernised. As a result, Barcelona gained <strong>kilometres of beaches</strong> and reclaimed a large public space accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Sant Sebastià is easy to get to by metro and bus, as well as the Bicing bike-hire service. It is <strong>fully equipped</strong> for people with disabilities or reduced mobility to enjoy the sea without risk, with specially-adapted facilities like showers, toilets and access points, touch signs, and so on.</p>

<p>Barceloneta Beach is a good place to <strong>take a stroll</strong> or <strong>a dip</strong>, or <strong>do a bit of sport </strong>outdoors, any day of the year. It is a favourite beach of the locals, although a lot of tourists go there as well. It is only five minutes from the metro, has two showers, a games area, beach volleyball courts, advice and information points for people with disabilities, deckchairs, loungers, Bicing bike-hire stations, and more. The <strong>Espai</strong> <strong>de Mar</strong>, a centre for sporting, therapeutic and educational activities related to the sea, is worthy of a special mention. You can also get a bite to eat and something to drink at one of the many beach bars, cafes and restaurants.</p>
<p>As well as all this, Barceloneta has another important feature: standing right in the middle of the beach is Rebecca Horn&#8217;s rusty sculpture, <strong><em>L’estel ferit</em></strong>, or <strong><em>The Wounded Star</em></strong>, known locally as &#8220;els cubs&#8221; (the cubes). It cuts a solitary figure against the blue background of the sea and the sky, and turns this space into a symbol of the city.</p>
<h3>From Don Quijote to the Olympics</h3>
<p>At the start of the 17th century, when the Barceloneta neighbourhood was not yet in existence, much of this area was <strong>flooded by the sea</strong>. Over time, as a result of a build up of sand and construction in the port, the city reclaimed the land from the sea and was able to expand on this side too. Around 1600, though, the future Barceloneta beach was still quite a long way out and probably very inhospitable.</p>
<p>It was on that primitive beach that <strong>Cervantes</strong> set the famous, final duel between Quijote and Knight of the White Moon. So it was here on the Mediterranean coast that the poor Quijote had the last of his delirious adventures.</p>
<p>Nearly four centuries later, the beach at Barceloneta had been totally transformed and was ready to show itself to the world during the <strong>1992 Olympics</strong>.</p>

<p>With its four centuries of existence, Port Vell is the oldest part of the Port of Barcelona, and it is still in use today. It was the city&#8217;s <strong>first stable quay</strong>, where ships could dock to shelter from storms, and it effectively separated the city from the water.<br />
Created by scraping sand from the land to the sea, the construction of the port signified Barcelona&#8217;s opening up to other lands. It is this port that has given Barcelona, over the centuries, a common identity with other Mediterranean port cities: commercial, advanced, and a little bit roguish.</p>
<h3>A walk to the shore of the water</h3>
<p>Port Vell, now remodelled and converted into a seafront promenade that has won over the locals, extends from the imposing Gothic <strong>Drassanes Reials</strong>, the royal shipyards, to the <strong>Llotja de Mar</strong> exchange, an impressive Neoclassical building that hides inside it the remains of the old, Gothic-style Llotja. In between, at the <strong>Portal de la Pau</strong>, from where Columbus shows us the way to the Indies, there are new promenades over the water, such as the large, raisable walkway that joins this point to the modern <strong>Maremàgnum </strong>shopping centre. Contemporary art has also claimed this spot, and while on the land side there are works by <strong>Roy Lichtenstein </strong>and<strong> Xavier Mariscal</strong>, floating on the sea are sculptures by <strong>Jaume Plensa</strong>.<br />
But if there is something that steals the hearts of locals and visitors alike, it is <strong>the &#8220;golondrines&#8221;</strong>, recreational boats that for more than 125 years have been offering trips on the Mediterranean waters from Barcelona&#8217;s Port Vell, and which allow you a privileged view of the city from the sea.</p>

<p>Jammed in between the surrounding tall buildings, Parc de Can Sabaté is a garden few of Barcelona&#8217;s citizens have heard of, despite its importance to neighbourhood residents, who mobilised at the end of the 1970s to turn the site into a public space. Today, this green space allows visitors to relax in the shade of the trees or contemplate the <strong>water</strong> that is everywhere. Behind the columned <strong>pool</strong> there is also a little wooded area, children&#8217;s play areas and fountains.</p>
<h3>Discover the vegetation</h3>
<p>Despite its relatively small size, Parc de Can Sabaté has a variety of trees and plants that include typically <strong>Mediterranean</strong> and <strong>exotic</strong> species,among others, ginkgo, willow, Canadian poplar, eucalyptus, stone spine, holm oak and cypresses. The various species of palm, such as the date palm, <i>Phoenix canariensis</i> and <i>Washingtonia filifera, </i>also stand out.</p>

<p>Acacias, cypresses, lindens, plantains, pines and willows are just some of the <strong>hundreds of trees</strong> that border the park, offering shade and shelter to visitors. In the centre is a large space with sand pits for children to play in, picnic areas, places for walking that lead to the woodland area of Park Güell or allow visitors to enjoy nature, at the foot of the hills, all in the city centre. This park is <strong>partly hidden from view in Vallcarca</strong>, an area that is not well known by tourists, behind Park Güell, and serves as a stop along the way to discovering a<strong> less well-known part of Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>Water, nature and art</h3>
<p>For many years, Parc de la Creueta del Coll was <strong>an old stone quarry in</strong> the Coll neighbourhood, in the foothills of Collserola. This urban garden was converted into a <strong>leisure area</strong> for the public in the 1980s, partly thanks to popular action. It houses an impressive massive sculpture weighing 54 tons made of reinforced concrete suspended over a lake by four steel cables which was designed specifically for the site by the artist Eduardo Chillida. Entitled <em>Elogi de l’aigua</em>, the work is based on the myth of Narcissus who fell in love with his own reflection.</p>
<p>But what has won the hearts of the public is the <strong>huge lake</strong> in the shape of a crescent which was transformed into a pool for use by the public during the summer months, and is surrounded by tiered seating and terraces. A shallow pool that allows you to put up with the heat of the Barcelona summer.</p>
<p>It is also a pool in which to enjoy <strong>nature surrounded by art</strong>, as apart from swimming, one can admire the different works of art in the park: apart from the Chillida sculpture, visitors have the opportunity to contemplate the work by Ellsworth Kelly entitled <em>Totem</em> or the <em>Sol i Lluna</em> by Montserrat Altet.</p>
<p>Parc de la Creueta del Coll, which has an <strong>extension of almost two hectares</strong>, is fully accessible thanks to its ramps system, which permits easy access to any part.</p>

<p>Passeig de Gràcia is one of the <strong>most elegant and stately avenues in the city</strong>. It runs through the heart of the Eixample, where back in the early 20th century Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie filled it with magnificent buildings that still marvel visitors today. <strong>Just treasure the architectural gems</strong>, such as Casa Milà, also known as the Pedrera, or Quarry, and Casa Batlló, two houses built by the Modernista architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, and another two Modernista mansions, Casa Amatller i Fuster and Casa Lleó Morera, designed respectively by <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong> and <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong>.</p>
<h3>An exclusive avenue</h3>
<p>It was called <i>Camí de Jesús</i> (Jesus Way), in times gone by, and was a rough country road that linked the city with the then small town of Gràcia. In 1906, the architect <strong>Pere Falqués</strong> took on the job of designing the avenue and you can still sit on his <strong>spectacular white mosaic</strong> <strong>benches</strong> which also serve as the base of the prettiest lampposts in the city. The paving is another unmistakable sign of his work: the <strong><i>panots</i></strong>, or hexagonal tiles, designed by <strong>Gaudí </strong>in 1904 and decorated with floral motifs, which the city restored at the end of the last century as a tribute to this most international of Catalan architects. Today Passeig de Gràcia is <strong>one of the city&#8217;s most exclusive shopping hubs</strong> and home to an upmarket range of shops, restaurants and hotels.</p>

<p>There are numerous <strong>sports and recreational facilities</strong> in the park, including football, pétanque and pelota courts, basketball baskets, a kids&#8217; recreation area and a place for dogs.

<p>The industrial past of the <strong>La Sagrera</strong> neighbourhood is strongly linked to the old <strong>Hispano-Suiza</strong> factory, which later became the <strong>ENASA</strong> factory. The Hispano-Suiza car factory acquired the Industrial Harinera Barcelonesa company’s buildings in 1902, extending its facilities to manufacture luxury and racing cars. Hispano-Suiza cars became the most elegant and prestigious in the first three decades of the 20th century. Spain’s Francoist government nationalised Hispano-Suiza in 1946, giving it the name ENASA. The factory continued to manufacture vehicles until 1970, under the <strong>Pegaso</strong> brand and produced the famous Pegaso lorries.<br />
Once it closed its doors, the local people reclaimed the land for the neighbourhood and made this space, previously traversed by workers, a large park open to everyone. In Carrer de la Sagrera the doorway to the factory still remains standing, and it is now the main entrance to the neighbourhood&#8217;s green lung.</p>
<h3>Walk and take a break</h3>
<p>Inside, the shade of the palm trees shelters a series of brick benches that invite you to read or relax before entering the world outside. The park&#8217;s lush vegetation and a canal that begins its journey just beyond the door promise a cool, enchanting route. The paths that open up between wooded areas, esplanades surrounded by plane trees, pergolas and blooming flowerbeds are some of the surprises that the park offers.</p>
<p>Amongst the most unique highlights is <strong>a lake </strong>separating the two spaces which the park is divided into, the lower and the upper zones, formed by <strong>small hills </strong>that pay tribute to the gardens designed in the late nineteenth century by the architect <strong>Josep Fontserè</strong>. A sports centre and various children&#8217;s playground areas guarantee that the park is a place where everyone can enjoy their free time.</p>

<h3>Catalan cuisine of yesterday and today</h3>
<p>The rustic but elegant restaurant, offers <strong>traditional Catalan cuisine</strong> in a delightful setting in both the dining rooms and garden. Among its dishes there is no lack of authentic jewels of Catalan cooking, such as the rice soup, potato timbale with black <i>botifarra</i> sausage or the spinach dishes, not to mention the latest trends in current cuisine.</p>

<p>Next to the <strong>Sants train station </strong>lies one of the city’s most surprising green spaces: Parc de l’Espanya Industrial. Its impressive <strong>nine lighthouse towers act </strong>as beacons drawingattention to it from far away. The park extends along a <strong>terraced area with concrete steps </strong>that lead down to a large artificial lake. Here, a prominent statue of Neptune by Manuel Fluxà stands guard over the water, which is one of the <strong>four elements</strong> that inspired the park, along with earth, fire and air. An <strong>enormous dragon</strong> by the Basque sculptor Andrés Nagel watches over the area and tempts children and adults to climb onto its back for an enjoyable way to take in the surroundings. Beyond the lake, willows, oaks, plane trees and cypresses make the park a <strong>bucolic landscape</strong> that is ideal for reading, picnicking or just relaxing.</p>
<h3>Building on the past</h3>
<p>Designed by <strong>architects Luis Peña Ganchegui</strong>,<strong> Antón Pagola and Montserrat Ruiz</strong> in 1985,the park is a modern space that stands on land that used to belong to the country’s leading cotton company, l’Espanya Industrial, which gives the park its name. The factory that stood there from the middle of the nineteenth century (commonly known as El Vapor Nou) was <strong>extremely important</strong> for the neighbourhood, as it provided work for 2,500 people in 1880 and remained operational until 1972. Some of the old factory facilities are now used for social purposes, such as the <strong>Casa del Mig </strong>youth information centre.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>An eclectic gem</h3>
<p>The history of the building which today houses the Sants-Montjuïc district offices dates back to the mid-19th century, when the <strong>local residents of Hostafrancs</strong>, which was already part of the city of Barcelona, petitioned the council for a municipal building where they could undertake administrative procedures without having to go to Plaça de Sant Jaume. The result was the <strong>Tinença d’Alcaldia d’Hostafrancs</strong>, the Deputy Mayor&#8217;s seat, which immediately had to be enlarged with the construction, in 1885, of the building designed by the Modernista architect Jaume Gustà i Bondia, which is still standing today. The annexing of the former town of Sants in 1897 meant that the Tinença d’Alcaldia building started to serve the entire new district, and it soon required a further extension. Work was resumed between 1908 and 1915, at the hands of Ubaldo Iranzo i Eiras, and it was at this time that the Noucentista windows were incorporated into the Sala de Plens.</p>
<h3>The Sala de Plens</h3>
<p>With a lavishly decorated facade, principally featuring floral elements, the interior of the building is particularly special. The <strong>Modernista style</strong> of the City Hall&#8217;s Sala de Plens, with a mosaic floor, capitals sculpted with female figures, iron beams and a ceiling decorated with floral sgraffito, contrasts with the large Noucentista stained glass windows that flood the space with colour. Made in 1914 by Francesc Labarta i Plana, they depict <strong>everyday scenes </strong>of industry, commerce and agriculture, the typical activities of the district&#8217;s residents at that time<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>The history of Ateneu Popular 9 Barris began in 1977 when the locals fought to reclaim an <strong>old asphalt plant</strong> and turn it into a <strong>sociocultural centre</strong>. Since then, the Ateneu’s work has been related to <strong>artistic and social activities</strong> under the management of the Associació Bidó de Nou Barris, and it has become a model for the whole of Barcelona.</p>
<h3>The circus as an emblem</h3>
<p>One of the main goals of Ateneu Popular 9 Barris since its beginnings has been to provide artistic and social training in <strong>a number of disciplines</strong>, with a special focus on the circus. This work started off with workshops and it was consolidated through the creation of the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Infantil de Circ </strong>(Children’s Circus School) in 1984 and the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Juvenil de Circ</strong> (Youth Circus School) in 2003. The centre has also hosted the <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>de Circ Rogelio Rivel</strong> (Rogelio Rivel Circus School) since 1999, which offers a two-year programme designed to train circus professionals.</p>
<p>The desire to spread popular culture and the fact that it hosts a theatre have also made it an <strong>essential setting</strong> for quality shows from national and international circus companies, and locals pay affordable prices to attend these.</p>
<p>Ateneu Popular 9 Barris has also been putting on its own productions since 1996, when it created the emblematic <strong>Circ d’Hivern</strong> (Winter Circus). This initiative allows professional companies to stage shows that have not been done before and means <strong>a new show every Christmas.</strong> The work this influential centre does earned it the 2015 Barcelona Medal of Honour.</p>

<p>Parc Joan Miró, also known as &#8220;parc de l’escorxador&#8221; (abattoir park), is in <strong>Esquerra de l&#8217;Eixample,</strong> very near Plaça Espanya and just behind the <strong>Les Arenes</strong> shopping centre.&nbsp;It was one of the first <strong>recreational areas</strong> to be created at the end of the 1970s with a <strong>spirit of innovation</strong> that sensed the need for green spaces in urban areas, precisely what Ildefons&nbsp;Cerdà had envisaged in creating the Eixample.This wide, open space is a meeting point for all the locals of the area, who can <strong>relax</strong>, walk their dogs and let their children play.It also houses a <strong>library</strong>, named after Joan Miró too, which has an extensive children&#8217;s section where a range of activities are held.</p>
<h3>Tribute to a Catalan artist</h3>
<p>Created in 1979 by a group <strong>of young architects</strong> led by Beth Galí, Parc Joan Miró covers the site of what was formerly the <strong>Barcelona Abattoir</strong>.Its straight structure surrounds a square where all types of events are held.The <strong>woodland areas</strong> include black poplars, pines,palm trees and holm oaks. There are also table-tennis tables, pétanque courts and a bar to enjoy a drink outdoors.<br /> One of the highlights is <strong>the sculpture</strong> standing twenty metres high and created by the artist himself. Called <strong><em>Dona i ocell (Woman and bird)</em></strong>, it is by one of the park exits and was unveiled in 1983,just before the artist&#8217;s death.<br /> Parc Joan Miró offers a place of recreation and peace which opens up like a green lung in the middle of the city.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>An urban wood</h3>
<p>The Turó de la Peira park is not just another park, it feels more like a wood. It lies in the Nou Barris district and can be reached from the Can Peguera and Turó de la Peira neighbourhoods that surround it, embrace it and almost keep it a secret. It is spread over nearly <strong>eight hectares</strong>, and delving into its <strong>leafy pine grove</strong> and enjoying the smell of Mediterranean vegetation encourages you to forget you are in a city.</p>
<p>It opened as a public park in 1936, under the Second Republic, and it occupies the site of an old quarry that had belonged to the Marchioness of Castellbell. In 1977 it was expanded and given a new layout before being completely renovated in 2007, when it acquired its current size and the new facilities it has today.</p>
<h3>Climb to the top</h3>
<p>The park winds its way up the hill it is named after in a <strong>spiral of circular paths</strong> that take you to the top. There are also stone steps that let you climb there in a straight line. Along the way are <strong>resting places</strong>, with benches, platforms, children&#8217;s playgrounds and picnic areas. The scenery gradually changes as the lower part, predominantly <strong>landscaped and grassy</strong>, gives ways to the <strong>leafy pine grove</strong> higher up.</p>
<p>Whichever path you take, they all lead to the summit 140 metres above sea level, dominated by a cross and with an impressive viewpoint. Getting there is a real treat because it offers some unique, 360º views of the city, and you can see the Collserola and the sea at the same time.</p>

<p>Parc de la Guineueta was created in 1971 to provide a working-class neighbourhood that had grown rapidly with some green spaces. Since 1950 it had absorbed many of the immigrants who had come from the south, as well as many of the people who used to live in the nearby shacks. The park immediately became a <strong>vital organ </strong>of the neighbourhood and the pride of its residents.</p>
<h3>Adapted to the abrupt terrain</h3>
<p>Parc de la Guineueta follows the outline of an old gully, which explains its elongated shape and pronounced slope. It is the work of the architect and landscape gardener Joaquim Maria Casamor, who designed it on the basis of a <strong>long parterre</strong> with a central lake, either side of which parallel paths drop down to the main entrance. There is a <strong>square </strong>at the top of the park where festive events are held and, on the outskirts, there are some municipal facilities: a nursery school, a sports centre and a primary school.</p>

<p>The former <strong>Casa de les Altures</strong>, built in the late 19th century and the home of the chairman of the <strong>Barcelona Water Company</strong>, was surrounded by 15,000 square metres of land belonging to several estates that had been expropriated so water tanks could be built there. Part of the land was used as the house&#8217;s garden and another as nurseries for various species of plant and tree.</p>
<p>The estate was in a poor state of repair during the early 1970s, so the <strong>Joan Maragall Residents Association</strong> reclaimed it for the neighbourhood. Finally, <strong>two hectares</strong> were restored as a public park which opened as Les Aigües Park.</p>
<h3>Fruit and ornamental trees</h3>
<p>The vegetation that grows in the park includes a great variety of fruit trees, such as <strong>orange and fig trees</strong> <strong>that are exceptional </strong>for the age and textures of their trunks.

<p>Guinardó Park, which <strong>slopes uphill, </strong>and which was formerly used mainly for agricultural purposes, is one of the largest green spaces in Barcelona. It has <strong>three very distinct areas:</strong> the lower part is a typical urban park, there are historic garden in the middle while the woodland at the top offers an unexpected surprise in the midst of the city.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Niño del Aro </em></strong>sculpture, created by <strong>Joaquim Ros i Bofarull </strong>in 1961, dominates the entrance to the park. Beyond it, a series of <strong>benches, steps and playgrounds </strong>opens up like the threshold to an extraordinary natural sanctuary.</p>
<h3>Water and mountains</h3>
<p>The <strong>historical gardens</strong> were designed in 1918 in a project led by landscape architects Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier and Nicolau M. Rubió i Tudurí, who envisaged <strong>Classicism-inspired Mediterranean gardens </strong>with water as the main feature, flowing through various fountains, channels and small pools. Perhaps the most famous is the <strong>Font del Cuento</strong>, where locals and especially couples used to go in search of a quiet corner in years gone by.</p>
<p>The landscape at the top of the park is dominated by a <strong>forest</strong> of pine, cedar and oak trees. Its steep paths intertwine on their way up to the<strong> Mitja</strong> <strong>Lluna viewpoint</strong>, which offers impressive views of the city.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Barcelona&#8217;s oldest garden</h3>
<p>Parc del Laberint d’Horta is the only one of its kind in the city, <strong>a bucolic and historical space </strong>in the <strong>Horta-Guinardó</strong> district that was constructed in the late 18th century, and is the oldest park in Barcelona.</p>
<p>It is comprised of <strong>two different gardens </strong>: one, an 18th century <strong>Neoclassical </strong>garden which extends across three stepped terraces and revolves around the theme of love, and another 19th century <strong>Romantic </strong>garden, which revolves around the theme of death and is located on the left side of the park. When you enter the cypress tree maze in the centre of the park, which has become an iconic spot, you are rewarded with the famous statue of Eros, and nearby, at the exit, the grotto of Echo and Narcissus.</p>
<h3>An open-air museum</h3>
<p>Considered to be a <strong>garden-museum</strong>, the Laberint d’Horta has also been used as the setting for a number of films that wanted to capture its charm. These include <em>Perfume</em>, by director Tom Tykwer, released in 2006. The park contains both Neoclassical and Romantic features that create a curious mix that appeals to all visitors: <strong>pavilions </strong>with Tuscan columns, <strong>mythological sculptures</strong>, symmetrical gardens, <strong>fountains and water jets </strong>that form a <strong>waterfall</strong> at the same time, moss and wild plants, gardens that are more wild and less landscaped, and so on. Wild nature and domesticated nature, both coming together in a single place representing the two opposing spirits of each era. It was created by Italian <strong>gardener Domenico Bagutti</strong>, commissioned by Marquis Antoni Desvalls, who owned the estate until the 1960s when it became a place for public use. It is open to the public every day but has a <strong>limited capacity </strong>of 750 people.</p>

<p>Turó Park owes its name to <strong>the old amusement park</strong> there used to be in the grounds of the <strong>Bertrand-Girona family</strong> until 1929. After an agreement was reached between the family and the City Council, <strong>Nicolau M. Rubió i Tudurí,</strong> then director of the Barcelona parks service, suggested building Turó Park on the estate as we know it today.</p>
<p>The park, dedicated to the poet <strong>Eduard Marquina,</strong> is <strong>compact and elegant</strong>, and it retains a large part of the <strong>original trees</strong>, such as a hundred-year-old carob tree, laurel trees, poplars, holm oaks, etc. One of the best parts of the park is the <strong>pond, </strong>surrounded by trees and covered by water lilies that flower in spring.</p>
<h3>Music and poetry</h3>
<p>Another notable feature is the <strong>Boulangrin parterre</strong>, with its mix of English and Arabian features, a little stream, sixteen large magnolias and stone benches for sitting on.</p>
<p>But its <strong>artistic and cultural</strong> value also lies in the sculptures, such as the one Apel·les Fenosa dedicated to the <strong>cellist Pau Casals</strong> and <strong>Josep Clarà</strong>&#8216;s tribute to the Catalan tenor Francesc Viñas. On top of that there is a <strong>poetic route</strong> that invites you to discover the park with the help of poets such as Sylvia Plath, Fernando Pessoa, Salvador Espriu and Federico García Lorca.</p>

<p>The gardens are criss-crossed by interconnecting <strong>macadam paths</strong>.

Although the hillside is fairly steep, there are ramps to make walking around easier. This green area measures nearly <strong>five hectares </strong>and it is full of really varied vegetation, mostly of Mediterranean origin. The large number of trees and bushes make this park a kind of <strong>nicely organised woodland area</strong>.</p>
<h3>A 360-degree vantage point</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to get to the top of the hill from the upper end, at <strong>Carrer de Marmellà</strong>: you just have to climb some stone steps which lead to a vantage point with a sea view. This vantage point has a 360-degree <strong>view of the city</strong> where you can see Tibidabo and the <strong>Serra de Collserola</strong> range, Creueta del Coll, the seafront, Montjuïc and the <strong>Llobregat plain</strong>. If you prefer to climb up the path, you have to enter the gardens from <strong>Carrer de Manacor</strong> and follow the paths leading from the entrance square, paved with stone tiles.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A park with something for everyone</h3>
<p>Spending a day in the park, alone or with family, is an excellent option for<strong> outdoor recreation</strong>. There are lots of things to do here: one can take a stroll, go running, enjoy the exceptional views of the city, visit the ruins of the<strong> castle</strong> built by the powerful Tous family during the 1880s and partially <br /> destroyed during the Civil War, enjoy an <strong>organic meal</strong> made from local products, take the children for a <strong>pony</strong> ride or else jump on board the miniature <strong>train</strong>. There is also a horse-riding centre where you can take riding lessons, and there are also specific areas for dogs. The park offers an endless list of activities for both young and old.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean vegetation</h3>
<p>The Castell de l’Oreneta park has a typically <strong>lush Mediterranean forest</strong> with white pines, stone pines, cork and other oaks, carob trees and a rich undergrowth of shrubs (Spanish broom, boxtree, viburnum, strawberry tree, mastic) and aromatic plants such as thyme, bay leaf and lavender. All these native species coexist with planted species such as <br /> eucalyptus, cypress, cedar and hackberry and trees that attest to the park&#8217;s agricultural past: orange, medlar, almond and olive trees.</p>

<p>This green area was originally the <strong>sumptuous garden </strong>that Ignasi Girona built on his Sarrià estate and named after his wife, Amèlia de Vilanova. The family used the Quinta Amèlia as a summer home for many years but in 1930, when Barcelona City Council designated the land as a <strong>public park</strong>, the estate was expropriated and the Girona family&#8217;s former residence was demolished. Part of the land now forms part of the neighbouring Vil·la Cecília Gardens, located on the other side of Carrer de Santa Amèlia.</p>
<h3>A fusion of nature and art</h3>
<p>Around fifty plant species grow in the gardens, but the ones that attract most attention are the trees listed in <strong>Barcelona&#8217;s Trees of Local Interest Catalogue,</strong> including a plane tree that is nearly 90 years old. There is a bronze figure of a Dryad, or tree nymph, in the middle of a pond. It is considered to be one of Ricard Sala&#8217;s finest sculptures. And nearby, there is an ephebe playing the flute, the <i>Encantador de serps</i> (Snake Charmer), a bronze sculpture by the Belgian artist Jules Anthone.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Botanical trials</h3>
<p>The Acclimatisation Gardens in Barcelona are one of the places of greatest <strong>botanical interest </strong>in the city, as they were expressly designed as a <strong>place for trying </strong>to acclimatise plant species. Their history dates back to 1930, when Nicolau Rubió i Tudurí decided to create the largest acclimatisation trial ever carried out in Barcelona in order to enrich the flora of the city&#8217;s gardens. The more than <strong>230 species of plants </strong>and the exceptional tranquility of the space make these gardens a unique place.</p>
<p>Divided into <strong>two levels </strong>joined by a large <strong>stone stairway</strong>, the gardens are home to an extensive variety of flower beds, with creepers and trees that are unique to each of them, and with a sign displaying the name of each plant so visitors do not miss anything. Among the <strong>more curious species </strong>are the Goldenrain tree from China which is located right at the entrance to the garden, a ziziphus shrub, a white ball acacia, a strawberry myrtle and many more.</p>
<h3>A symbolic olive tree</h3>
<p>As well as the numerous species of flora found in the garden, it is also home to other valuable features, such as the <strong>Barcelona AIDS Memorial</strong> which was inaugurated in 2003 and was designed by gardener Lluís Abad. The memorial project was presented to Parks and Gardens by the NGO Projecte dels Noms, set up in 1993 to promote public awareness of AIDS. It is an olive tree, the <strong>symbol of peace and eternity</strong>, which stands in a flower bed with elongated paving stones on which a poem by Miquel Martí i Pol has been engraved.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Filmo&#8221;, as it is popularly known among locals and which was previously located in the higher part of the city, is dedicated to everything that has anything to do with <strong>cinematographic culture. </strong>It shows <strong>classic movies</strong>, but is also a place for festivals and programmes exploring <strong>new audiovisual languages</strong>. I addition, the Filmoteca is a leader in the field of film research: it preserves <strong>thousands of movies </strong>from private collections that make up the country&#8217;s <strong>film heritage</strong>. The main advantage is that here, the cost of enjoying good cinema is well below market price.</p>
<h3>Conservation and Restoration Centre</h3>
<p>The neighbouring town of Terrassa is home to the Filmoteca de Catalunya&#8217;s <strong>Restoration and Conservation Centre</strong>. Here you can discover how films are restored, catalogued and preserved in both photochemical and digital formats. A visit allows you to enter the <strong>cold storage chambers where the archives are kept</strong>. Filmoteca de Catalunya is part of the Raval Cultural project, a collection of over three hundred cultural offerings from the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In the foothills of Montjuïc near the emblematic Teatre Grec there stands the <strong>Ciutat del Teatre</strong>, the city of theatre, where the Institut del Teatre has been located since the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
<p>This institute is the oldest dance and theatre training centre in Barcelona. It was set up in 1913 by <strong>Adrià Gual</strong> under the name <strong>Escola</strong> <strong>Catalana d’Art Dramàtic</strong> (Catalan School of Dramatic Arts), to make culture an institution and to modernise the Catalan theatre scene. In 1939 it adopted the name by which it is still known, the Institut del Teatre, and in 1952 it became the <strong>Escola Superior d’Art Dramàtic i Dansa</strong>. At the beginning of the 1980s it set up shop in Carrer de Sant Pere Més Baix in Ciutat Vella, in the building which is now the Espai Bonnemaison, where it trained the <strong>generations of actors</strong> that today tread the boards in the city&#8217;s theatres, and this is where it remained until it moved to its new home in 2000.</p>
<h3>Reflecting creativity</h3>
<p>With this move, the Institut del Teatre also gained a <strong>new status</strong>, that of a centre involved in teaching, culture, research and promotion.</p>
<p>It includes the Escola Superior d’Art Dramàtic, the Conservatori Superior de Dansa, the Escola d’Ensenyament Secundari i Artístic (a theatre school at secondary level) and the Escola Superior de Tècniques de les Arts de l’Espectacle (a college for performing arts technicians). In addition it houses the performing arts archives and museum, the Centre de Documentació i el <strong>Museu de les Arts Escèniques</strong>, which is home to one of the most important collections of documents in Europe, specialising in <strong>Catalan theatre </strong>and the Spanish Golden Age.</p>
<p>To further its founding aim, the Institut del Teatre acts as one of the most important focal points of Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>cultural scene</strong>, offering continual samples of the work being developed by the next generation in the world of performing arts. For this reason, in 1996 the dance company <strong>IT Dansa</strong> was set up, which helps young dancers bring their projects to the public, as well as <strong>Festival NEO</strong> (Noves Escenes Obertes), which is a platform raising the profile of new artists in the world of theatre today.</p>

<p>Apart from being a venue for cycle races and competitions, the Horta Cycle Track is also a facility <strong>at the service of the citizens</strong> of Barcelona. There are therefore activities open to everyone, such as <strong>courses for beginners</strong> to the world of cycling for children and adults, and coaching processes. You can also enjoy sports massages, the adjoining BMX circuit and the natural setting of Collserola Park. Very nearby you can also see a visual poem by <strong>Joan Brossa</strong>.</p>
<h3>Municipal cycling school</h3>
<p>The facility is also the Centre of the <strong>Catalan Cycling Federation</strong> and the <strong>Municipal Cycling School</strong>. The school is a sports project aimed at educating children as people and citizens through cycling, with road safety skills, but at the same time instilling human values such as teamwork and effort.</p>
<p>The Cycle Track opened in 1984 for the World Track Cycling Championship. It was designed by the architects <strong>Esteve Bonell and Francesc Rius</strong> in collaboration with the German specialist Herbert Schürmann. The facility was awarded the <strong>FAD prize for Architecture</strong> in 1984.</p>

<p>Parc de Cervantes is a large <strong>green space </strong>filled with lawns and trees that has two entrances: Avinguda Diagonal, which is the main entrance, and a more hidden entrance, via the Ronda de Dalt. Throughout the year it is common to find people jogging or riding bike here, or simply going for a walk and resting on the benches. However, the real show begins with the arrival of spring when its more than <strong>10,000 rose bushes </strong>come into bloom and fill the four-hectare park with an array of <strong>colours and scents</strong>.</p>
<p>Classified and divided into carefully arranged flower beds, the ideal way to discover the roses and <strong>enjoy their splendour </strong>is to take a gentle stroll along the lawns that demarcate them and if you go bear foot, even better. This <strong>botanical circuit </strong>enables you to travel across four continents and to learn about the difficult art of <strong>cultivating roses</strong>.</p>
<h3>Place of traditions</h3>
<p>Each year the <strong>Barcelona New Roses </strong>competition is held in the park. Since 2001 this competition has been attempting to revive the city&#8217;s <strong>rose-growing tradition</strong>, which began in the early part of the 20th century. The garden is located on the land previously occupied by the <strong>Estela</strong> stream, into which the water from the top of <strong>Sant Pere Màrtir</strong> used to flow. The architectural and artistic value of the park lies in a series of <strong>sculptures</strong>, such as the <strong><em>Rombes Bessons</em></strong> by Andreu Alfaro, and the female nude <em>Serenitat</em>, made by Eulàlia Fàbregues de Sentmenat. Parc de Cervantes is the only one of its kind in Barcelona and it has all the attractions of a green space, providing the district with <strong>peace and tranquility </strong>and <strong>place to relax</strong>, but it also boasts a <strong>real gem </strong>in the form of the <strong>rose gardens </strong>that are not to be missed.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Gaudí&#8217;s footprint</h3>
<p>The highlights of the gardens are the two pieces by Antoni Gaudí: a <strong>lath house</strong> —a pergola covered in climbing plants— and the Font d’Hèrcules, the fountain of Heracles, which the Catalan architect created for Eusebi Güell. The <strong>Font d’Hèrcules</strong> is located in a bamboo copse, and has a wrought iron spout in the shape of a dragon&#8217;s head from where the water flows.For many years it remained hidden by vegetation, and was only discovered in 1984 during cleaning work.</p>
<h3>The <i>kolonihaven</i></h3>
<p>A modern artistic twist is provided by the <i>Kolonihaven</i>, a children&#8217;s play house designed by architects Enric Miralles and Benedetta Tagliabue to celebrate the European cultural capital, Copenhagen. But the park is home to <strong>other sculptures</strong>, like <i>Nu femení agenollat </i>(Nude female kneeling), by Joan Borrell i Nicolau; <i>Mediterrània </i>(Mediterranean) by Eulàlia Fàbregas de Sentmenat, and <i>Nu </i>(Nude) a bronze by Enric Casanovas (1930).</p>
<p>The origin of the gardens goes back to a fire that in 1875 destroyed the <strong>royal family&#8217;s Barcelona residence</strong>, situated in the flat area of the Palau. The new royal residence, built in 1921, was sponsored by the then Mayor of Barcelona <strong>Joan Antoni Güell</strong>, and the Güell family donated a plot of land on which it could be built.</p>

<p>The Santa Maria de Valldonzella Convent is a typical example of <strong>historicist Modernisme</strong>, which reinterprets styles from previous periods.

<h3>From cistercians to the 21st century</h3>
<p>The origins of the present-day Valldonzella Convent go back to a small Romanesque hermitage in the Serra de Collserola range. From its foundation to the 20th century, this community of nuns suffered a series of incidents, sackings and changes of location, until they finally moved to the present-day building, built especially for the community, in 1913. In accordance with Benedictine traditions, the community offers <strong>accommodation</strong> to groups and individuals who wish to spend some days in spiritual retreat and attend the community&#8217;s liturgical ceremonies.</p>

The variety of both local and foreign produce and the quality, friendly service and reasonable prices are a source of pride for <strong>merchants and locals </strong>alike. The refurbishment work also converted this site into a market of the future, ready to meet the challenges of twenty-first century without losing the popular spirit that has always defined this site.</p>
<p>The Mercat del Poblenou currently houses <strong>22 food stalls </strong>and a self-service establishment. The design of the commercial units is distinctive, as it has allowed the market to introduce two self-service fruit and vegetable stalls for the first time.</p>
<h3>European architecture</h3>
<p>The Mercat del Poblenou was designed in 1889 by the architect Pere Falqués and, although modest in size with simple lines, it is truly beautiful. The building, with <strong>brick walls and an iron roof</strong>, consists of a central body and two side sections and reflects the architectural trends popular that became popular here in the late-nineteenth century, inspired by new buildings in Paris and London.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>Municipal architecture with its own style</h3>
<p>The construction of Mercat del Clot should be seen in the context of the powerful growth of Barcelona during the <strong>nineteenth century,</strong> and the subsequent need to provide the various neighbourhoods and adjacent towns with functional buildings suitable for accommodating markets. Following the <strong>trends in</strong> <strong>London and Paris </strong>(particularly Les Halles), Barcelona City Council decided to establish a network of markets that were characterised by a common structure: <strong>a metal frame with bare brick walls</strong>.</p>
<p>The architect responsible for the design of Mercat del Clot was <strong>Pere Falqués</strong>, who made it almost identical to another nearby market, Mercat del Poblenou. Both markets became not only vital trade centres and meeting points in the <strong>Sant Martí district</strong>, but also emblematic examples of a type of building typical of Modernista Barcelona.</p>
<h3>Cathedrals of the Mediterranean diet</h3>
<p>The sale of local, fresh and quality produce, the personal service and the professionalism of the people who work there make the markets authentic temples for a <strong>healthy diet</strong>. The Municipal Institute of Markets (IMMB) was established in Barcelona in 1991with the aim of preserving and promoting a <strong>market culture in the city</strong>. As a result, at Mercat del Clot and many others, activities are organised that go beyond mere buying and selling, and include such initiatives as workshops and talks on cooking and food, exhibitions, itineraries, etc. For example, during El Clot <em>festa major </em>local festivities, the market organises a <strong>“Nit de Tapes” </strong>(Tapas Night), as do many of the city’s municipal markets, live music, lucky draws, special offers and other events.</p>

<p>In the mid-nineteenth century, Barcelona City Council promoted the construction of <strong>covered markets </strong>to regulate the many street vendor who set up their stalls in the open air all around the city. In those times, Sant Andreu de Palomar was still an <strong>independent township,</strong> and local farmers continued to gather in Plaça de Marcadal to sell their wares directly to local residents.</p>
<p>When, in 1897, Sant Andreu de Palomar became Barcelona’s ninth district, the City Council decided to provide it with a well-equipped, covered, safe facility. The square was therefore roofed by a <strong>steel structure</strong> in 1914, whilst the interior was furnished at a later date.</p>
<h3>Lifelong stalls</h3>
<p>Many of the vendors who work on the stalls at the Mercat de Sant Andreu today are descendants of the <strong>original street sellers</strong>, and some are even fourth or fifth generation stallholders. The <strong>centenary </strong>in 2014 was a celebration that brought a lot of joy to the whole neighbourhood, along with a renewed sense of optimism with which to face the century’s new challenges, including refurbishment of the market itself.</p>

<p>Today, the <strong>modern façade</strong> of Mercat de la Guineuetaand the lattice of <strong>LED lights </strong>that can be seen on Passeig de Valldaura act like a signal beckoning you to come inside. The building, which was renovated in 2011, has managed to adapt perfectly to the times without losing the any of the <strong>essence</strong> <strong>that has characterised it</strong> since its creation back in 1965.</p>
<p>The market was constructed in response to a need to supply the people who had just arrived in the area at a time when the Guineueta neighbourhood and the rest of the Nou Barris district were growing as a result of the <strong>waves of migration</strong>. Built as a commercial centre selling <strong>fresh produce</strong>, it was the area’s only large space for food shopping until the 1980s and this made it a vital <strong>commercial and social epicentre</strong> for many generations in the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Improvements that all add up</h3>
<p>The renovation of the Mercat de la Guineueta was a <strong>turning point</strong> and it represented a determined, modern leap into the twenty-first century. Led by the architect Daniel Mòdol, the refurbishment involved a significant expansion of the market area, which now measures <strong>6,500 square metres</strong>. Thanks to its <strong>big canopy</strong>,a square was also created opening onto the main entrance at Passeig de Valldaura and it is always bustling with life. </p>
<p>After this makeover and in step with Barcelona’s constant renovation, the shops in the Mercat de la Guineueta have continued to uphold the <strong>long-standing values</strong> of providing top-quality products and offering the best possible service</p>

<p>The retail trade in Horta, as in other parts of the city, is fully integrated into the <strong>social and cultural life</strong> of the neighbourhood. Proof of this is the <strong>iconic market</strong>, which everyday supplies homes in nearby neighbourhoods as well as others further afield.</p>
<p>Horta Market was inaugurated in <strong>1951</strong>, when a covered building was constructed to house it on Carrer del Tajo, where it still stands today. Despite that, the market&#8217;s <strong>commercial origins</strong> in the neighbourhood go back much further, because there were some small stalls in the nearby Plaça d&#8217;Eivissa, then known as Market Square, in 1886.</p>
<h3>Old values maintained</h3>
<p>The stalls with a <strong>family tradition</strong> still maintain and value the <strong>personal treatment</strong>, and that is one of the more noticeable things about Horta Market, along with its quality handmade produce.</p>
<p>As a <strong>fresh food</strong> market, it sells meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, dairy produce and so on. But there are also bars where you can have breakfast, and stalls where you can buy other things such as clothes, shoes and lots more. The <strong>wide range</strong> of products is available to locals and everyone else in Barcelona, because tradition and the market&#8217;s <strong>good location</strong> mean people come here from all over. What&#8217;s more, as a member of the Cor d’Horta i Mercat Federation, the market forms part of a very active <strong>shopping hub</strong>.</p>

<p>The 2009 <strong>renovation</strong> meant the market was modernised and adapted to meet today&#8217;s needs without losing its essence. It is a very valuable <strong>Modernista building</strong> in terms of heritage and has a long tradition in the neighbourhood. The remodelling resulted in a bigger surface area and better services, leading to a <strong>considerable increase </strong>in visitors: customers went from 936,000 in the year before it was renovated to more than 1,800,000 after, almost double!</p>
<h3>Modernista building</h3>
<p >Llibertat Market, which opened in 1893, fit in with the contemporary trend for public buildings, such as stations and markets, which adopted the Modernista style while integrating the <strong>new construction systems</strong> used in European buildings such as Les Halles in Paris.</p>
<p>The building, designed by the then <strong>Gràcia municipal architect</strong> Miquel Pasqual Tintorer, has a rectangular structure and three aisles, a high, wide central aisle and two symmetrical side ones. These are covered by a pitched roof made of <strong>glazed ceramic</strong> tiles, supported by a <strong>metal structure</strong>. The walls are <strong>bare brick</strong> and have openings that let in air and natural light. The decoration, based on <strong>wrought iron</strong>, includes a coat of arms by Francesc Berenguer i Mestres, who was very close to Antoni Gaudí&#8217;s circle.</p>

<p >The earliest mention of the founding of the temple is in a document from <strong>987</strong>. This refers to the church, which at that time belonged to the Valldoreix parish. In the 13th century, Santa Maria split off and formed an independent parish. In the 16th century the <strong>current building </strong>was constructed with a single nave and a polygonal apse, flanked by a square <strong>bell tower</strong>, probably from the same period. The <strong>cemetery </strong>next door is another unique place: it is one of only two parish cemeteries which are still preserved in Barcelona.</p>
<h3>The mountain church</h3>
<p >The church has also lent its name to a <strong>recreational area </strong>surrounded by nature, the area of Santa Maria de Vallvidrera, a very beautiful spot within the <strong>natural park </strong>where you can walk, eat and enjoy the forest and architectural heritage of this town.</p>
<p>Despite the many communication links that have opened between the city and the old town of Vallvidrera, this still feels like a <strong>mountain village</strong>, quiet and oblivious to the bustle of the big city.</p>

<p>Burials are believed to have been held around the Sant Genís dels Agudells church since ancient times, as was the custom at old shrines. But the first <strong>written evidence of the existence </strong>of the cemetery appears in a document from 1060. A licence from the Vicar General of the Diocese granted in the 14th century to the <strong>friar-hermit Ponç Astars</strong> gave permission for the moveable altar to be put in the oratorio, which he himself had built, to celebrate Mass in and for building a cemetery.</p>
<h3>The last parish cemetery</h3>
<p>Parish cemeteries <strong>were banned in 1775</strong> for health reasons. <strong> Isolated or rural graveyards</strong>, such as that of Sant Genís, were spared the ban. The church of Sant Genís dels Agudells is of <strong>Romanesque origin</strong> with vestiges of earlier times, which include a fish, the symbol of the early Christians, engraved into the right-hand-side of the main door. It was extensively renovated in the 17th century. Following its consecration in 932, the parish had a <strong>sanctuary</strong> formed by the church, the cemetery and an area of thirty square feet granted by the bishop which enjoys ecclesiastic protection and immunity.</p>

<p>Adopting the model of other European cities that had municipal music schools, Barcelona City Council set up the Escola Municipal de Música to provide <strong>quality public education </strong>in music. The city&#8217;s <strong>Orquestra Municipal </strong>was set up at the same time and the orchestra ended up taking on students trained at the music school. It was originally located on <strong>Carrer de Lledó</strong>, in the Barri Gòtic, but moved a decade later to the majestic <strong>Castell dels Tres Dragons</strong>, a Modernista building in Parc de la Ciutadella that had been the café-restaurant at the Universal Exposition in 1888.</p>
<p>In 1928, the school moved to its current home in Carrer de Bruc, on one of the chamfered corners of Carrer de València. The building, which was designed by the <strong>municipal architect, Antoni de Falguera</strong>, has two towers on the main facade that combine the <strong>Modernista and Noucentista styles,</strong> where you can spot the influence of the famous architect <strong>Puig i Cadafalch</strong>, Falguera&#8217;s teacher. Today it is one of the city&#8217;s listed buildings.</p>
<h3>First public conservatory in Catalonia</h3>
<p>The Spanish government issued a decree in 1944 that turned the Escola Municipal de Música into the <strong>Conservatori Superior</strong>, or Higher Conservatory of Music, which it continued to operate as the until the start of the 21st century. During those years it was the <strong>only public centre in Catalonia</strong> that taught advanced music studies. It started to teach intermediate-level music studies in 2000 and became the Conservatori Municipal de Música de Barcelona in 2004.</p>

<p>It all started with an act of generosity from Agustí Massana, who donated 500,000 pesetas to the City Council to create a <strong>free school </strong>where working-class children could get an education. In<strong> 1929</strong>, the newly established Escola Massana opened on C/ Avinyó and later moved, in 1935, to its present-day building in the old Hospital de la Santa Creu. The school has been training professionals in the <strong>applied arts and crafts </strong>ever since, in fields as diverse as painting, jewellery making, metalwork, photography, illustration, engraving and costume and set design.</p>
<h3>A nest of artists and intellectuals</h3>
<p>Escola Massana plans to move to Plaça de la Gardunya, determined to continue its role as the vibrant and creative centre it has always been. The school divides its teaching into <strong>three main areas</strong> (visual arts, applied arts and design), covering every level in its range of educational offers: baccalaureates in art, vocational training, undergraduate degrees, Master&#8217;s degrees, postgraduate courses and ongoing training.</p>
<p>Its community brings together <strong>students and teaching staff from all around</strong> and notable alumni include Carme Solé Vendrell, Joan-Josep Tharrats, Roser Capdevila, Carme Ruscalleda, Quim Monzó and Pau Riba.</p>
<p>Escola Massana is part of the Raval Cultural project, a collection of over three hundred cultural offerings from the neighbourhood.</p>

Only those with their own niches are buried there these days, and the cemetery now has surveillance cameras.</p>

<p>The origins of Sant Andreu&#8217;s cemetery go back to the Middle Ages, when the Sant Andreu de Palomar parish graveyard had become too small. The authorities began to look for a new site in 1837 and finally it was decided to build the cemetery on land belonging to the <strong>Can Calç farmhouse</strong>, a quiet spot very near the Sant Andreu-Horta road on a small hill <strong>shielding the </strong>Sant Andreu <strong>stream</strong>. The cemetery was opened and blessed in 1839.</p>
<p>When Sant Andreu was incorporated into Barcelona in 1897, the cemetery became <strong>municipal property</strong>. The current façade on Carrer dels Garrofers dates from 1927, and the chapel was built in 1930.</p>
<h3>Hebrews, protestants and catholics</h3>
<p>One of the peculiar features of this graveyard is that it <strong>contains a Jewish site</strong> with underground burial chambers and vegetation, following the Jewish tradition. There is also an area reserved for Protestant burials. In 2012, the <strong>first stone laid in the wall</strong> surrounding the cemetery was recovered.</p>

<p>Sarrià Cemetery is in the <strong>Tres Torres</strong> neighbourhood: The entrance is on Carrer del Doctor Roux.

There are some references which date its origins at 1850, but the <strong>cemetery records</strong>, which were kept in the Sarrià parish church, were destroyed in a fire, and the first records we have now date from 1922.</p>
<h3>The cemetery of the poet Carles Riba</h3>
<p>There are few funerary vaults and monuments in this cemetery but a notable example is the one dedicated to <strong>Pharmacist Margenat</strong>, the Ombudsman of Sarrià Town Council, by his widow and children. It is also the last resting place of the painter<strong> Jaume Mercader</strong> and the husband and wife poets<strong> Carles Riba and Clementina Arderiu</strong>, whose tomb features a nice relief by the sculptor Joan Rebull.</p>

<p>The Montjuïc Cemetery, also known as the south-west cemetery, was officially opened on 17 March 1883 by the then mayor of Barcelona <strong>Francesc de Paula</strong> <strong>Rius i Taulet</strong>. One of its innovations was the space it reserved for <strong>burying non-Catholics</strong>, Protestants and Jews, for example. The first person buried there, as stated on his tombstone, was José Fonrodona Riva, a Catalan who had gone to South America to make his fortune and had been the mayor of Matanzas in Cuba.</p>
<p>The cemetery resembles an <strong>English garden</strong>, with its winding paths, beautiful perspectives and well-placed tombs. It has abundant vegetation and <strong>cypresses</strong> are its hallmark tree. Some 6,000 underground vaults and 70 family vaults had been built there by 1890. Today there are 152,327 tombs.</p>
<h3>Funeral Modernisme</h3>
<p>Given the era it was designed and built in, the cemetery represented the expression of <strong>Modernisme within funeral art</strong>. It is seen as a benchmark today and a must-visit for anyone who studies or enjoys Modernista architecture. You can find beautiful sculptures, engravings, stonework and ironwork on the tombstones, family vaults and architectural groups there. The cemetery is <strong>open throughout the year, </strong>every day, from 8 am to 6 pm.</p>

The building has a stainless steel and glass roof which becomes a play of mirrors.</p>
<p>The Mercat dels Encants de Barcelona-Fira de Bellcaire is considered to be one of the <strong>oldest fairs in Europe</strong> and some think that it could date back to the 15th century. What is certain is that since 1929, it has been located in <strong>Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes</strong>, where generations of traders and buyers have been able to sell or buy all types of old,new, curious or conventional articles at very affordable prices.</p>
<h3>A mixture of past and present</h3>
<p>Apart from the stalls which are set up every day,every Monday,Wednesday and Friday the famous <strong>auction </strong>, attended by <strong>antique collectors </strong> and enthusiasts of old articles, and unique in Catalonia and Europe, is held at seven in the morning .Today&#8217;s <strong>mixture</strong> of old traders,lifelong locals,tourists and young people looking for <em>vintage</em> clothes,makes Els Encants an <strong>interesting place</strong> to lose yourself for a while.</p>

<p>While the upper part of Gràcia traditionally belonged to the well-off, the southern end was where the factories, the <strong>working class</strong> and the humble houses were to be found. The market itself was built on the site of an old cotton mill called Vapor Nou, one of the most important factories of its day. More than a century has passed but the Abaceria still has that <strong>working-class market</strong> atmosphere it has always had.</p>
<h3 >Popular memory</h3>
<p >Like so many other centennial markets in Barcelona, the Abaceria Central has a <strong>metal structure</strong> enclosed in <strong>bare bricks</strong>, and consists of <strong>three aisles</strong>, a large central one and two, smaller side aisles. A notable feature of the building is the slightly curved roof, as if the ceiling were made of <strong>giant roof tiles</strong>.</p>
<p>This market has also been immortalised by the writer <strong>Merc</strong><strong>è Rodoreda</strong> in her novel <em>La pla</em><em>ça del Diamant</em>, because the main character, Natalia, a symbol of humble working women in Barcelona at the start of the 20th century, came here to shop.</p>

<p>Despite the extensive <strong>remodelling</strong> of the interior in 2007, the building was able to keep the original look given to it by the architects Arnau Calvet and Marcel·lí Coquillat, who laid it out as a rectangular enclosure with exposed brickwork in the facades and a metal framework.</p>
<p>The four walls are decorated with <strong>stained glass windows </strong>that allow natural light into the interior, in addition to brick borders. What stands out on the exterior is the main facade, facing west onto Carrer de Pere Tarrés, which is high and topped with a triangular structure. The protruding columns on the facades are also noteworthy.</p>
<h3>The market and the town of Sarrià</h3>
<p>The market is located in the <strong>old town </strong>of Sarrià, next to Plaça del Consell de la Vila and Carrer Major de Sarrià, and has witnessed the transformations in the neighbourhood, which in 1921 changed from being an independent town, to make up part of Barcelona. Despite being annexed, the area still retains the charm of a quiet village far from the metropolis, where the market plays an important role as a <strong>meeting place </strong>for local people and something that brings the neighbourhood together.</p>

            "#text": "<h3 >Barcelona gets bigger</h3>
<p>The city&#8217;s population growth during the 19th century and the building of the Eixample, starting in 1860, necessitated the planning of new public facilities, such as municipal markets. In the case of Galvany Market, the annexing of the Sant Gervasi neighbourhood to the city, in 1897, accentuated this need.</p>
<h3>An imposing building</h3>
<p >From an architectural point of view, the Mercat de Galvany follows the building fashions of the time, between <strong>Modernisme </strong>and the <strong>new trends </strong>based on the use of iron. The enclosed area is immense and organised around a large floor in the shape of a <strong>Greek cross </strong>(with four equal arms). Each of the four ends of the cross is enclosed by an exposed brick facade, while the roof stands on a metal framework supporting the <strong>large central dome</strong>. The interior is spectacular, bright and airy. It notably includes eight columns and large arches that support the dome, plus a <strong>Modernista lamp </strong>with a clock inside, located in the centre of the market.</p>
<p>The sober and elegant shapes, the exposed brick walls, the use of iron and the Modernista-inspired decorations based on stained glass and mosaic, make this building an iconic monument and very characteristic of the first third of the 20th century.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The evolution of a market</h3>
<p>The Market of Les Corts was built in 1961 in an <strong>area that was previously occupied by vegetable gardens. </strong>It was initially built to supply the people of the neighbourhood with fresh food at a time of major expansion in the <strong>neighbourhood of Les Corts</strong>. The structure took the form of the typical arch-roofed buildings of the period. It gradually became an essential part of the neighbourhood as it continued to grow. The market was remodelled In 1993 to help it adapt to the new commercial demands and the increase in the number of customers.</p>
<p>However, the ongoing <strong>modernization </strong>of the city and the neighbourhood of Les Corts resulted in the <strong>Municipal Institute of Markets</strong> deciding to remodel it once again in 2008. This time it underwent a complete reform managed by the company G56.</p>
<h3>Present and future</h3>
<p>The initiative opted for a <strong>radical transformation of the façade</strong>, that opens onto Travessera de les Corts, and the construction of an entrance at street level and a ramp designed to break the architectural barriers, making it <strong>accessible</strong> <strong>to all</strong>.</p>
<p>The stalls were also refurbished but they managed to <strong>keep the cheerful spirit </strong>that have been their hallmark since their beginnings as well as their<strong> essential purpose</strong>: that of offering top quality food. In recent years, the classical range of products on offer has been supplemented by several new proposals, and we can now find stalls that offer <strong>biological products and goods for gourmets</strong>.</p>

<p>The municipal architect <strong>Pere Falqués</strong>,responsible for a great many Modernista works and buildings, constructed the Mercat de Sants on land previously known as the Hort Nou, the new market garden. This new covered market opened in 1913, serving an increasingly more populous Sants neighbourhood, and it soon became the commercial and social hub of the area. The building, in three sections and with exposed brickwork, is an almost perfect example of Barcelona market architecture at the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
<p>The market is protected as a <strong>listed building </strong>and a piece of Barcelona&#8217;s architectural, historical and artistic heritage, and the passage of time made renovation necessary if it was to recover its former splendour.</p>
<h3>Efficient and modern</h3>
<p>The work, which began in 2009 and finished in 2014, was the responsibility of the architectural studio <strong>Pb2 Projecte</strong>, led by the architect Josep Llobet i Bach. The renovations respected the <strong>Modernista features </strong>on the facade so that the building still retains its original essence whilst having been <strong>altered and completely updated </strong>inside.</p>
<p>Each of the fifty stalls has been designed according to the vendors&#8217; wishes and the products they offer. In addition, the market now has <strong>new services</strong>, like parking spaces for 90 customers. The remodelling was also done with sustainability in mind and includes elements making the building a model of energy efficiency, like an air-conditioning system based on groundwater use and lighting with movement sensors, amongst other things.</p>

<p>Hostafrancs, which is among the group of markets in Barcelona that are already <strong>over 100 years old</strong>, is nevertheless much more than just a market. It is considered a <strong>nerve centre,</strong> not just for trade, but also for the <strong>human relationships</strong> that have been established over <strong>several generations</strong> among the residents of the <strong>Creu Coberta and Hostafrancs </strong>neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>When first established in the <strong>late nineteenth century</strong>, the market supplied workers at several nearby factories that had emerged as a result of the <strong>industrial growth in Sants </strong>at that time. The original structure was designed by <strong>architect Antoni Rovira i Trias</strong> and, despite various restoration projects, the architectural style of the period is still visible, with a <strong>steel structure</strong>, <strong>brick masonry </strong>walls and a row of arched windows over the main entrance.</p>
<h3>Values that are worth saving</h3>
<p>You can still experience the <strong>traditional flavour</strong> of this market every morning among the maze of <strong>family-run stalls</strong>, where the <strong>added value </strong>of a smile, a conversation and <strong>human warmth </strong>is always welcomed, and is something increasingly rare in bustling urban settings.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A market over one hundred years old</h3>
<p>In the nineteenth century, when Les Corts was still an independent township, separate from Barcelona, a <strong>travelling market</strong> used to be held in the streets that connected the city with what was then the neighbouring town. An <strong>outdoor market</strong> was opened in 1893 to regulate this activity and was originally called <strong>Mercat del Porvenir </strong>[“Prospect Market”], because it was located in a prosperous area. In fact, it wasn’t long before it adopted the name Mercat del Ninot [“Cabin Boy Market”], which it took from a nearby tavern that was well-known at the time for selling cheap wine. On its door, there was a ship’s figurehead of a cabin boy, which can now be found in Barcelona Maritime Museum.</p>
<p>The Mercat del Ninot was refurbished in 1933 according to <strong>plans drawn up by</strong> <strong>Antoni de Falguera,</strong> who transformed the site into a great space covered by a <strong>large metallic structure</strong>. The market is popular with local residents, who have been able to stock up with the <strong>quality products</strong> on offer there for over one hundred years.</p>
<h3>Combining past and present</h3>
<p>The Mercat del Ninot was completely remodelled via a project by Josep Lluís Mateo, from <strong>MAP Arquitectes</strong>. Work finished in 2015 and saw the market equipped with <strong>energy efficient measures,</strong> as well as a new façade with a <strong>modern</strong> <strong>image, </strong>but<strong> </strong>which also maintains<strong> traditional values.</strong></p>

<p>Without any doubt, the most characteristic feature of the striking Mercat de Santa Caterina is the <strong>ceramic mosaic</strong> that serves as a roof and pays tribute to the master, Antoni Gaudí. This mantle symbolically recalls the awnings covering the stalls in the olden days, fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Three of the facades of the old, white Neoclassical building have been preserved. Inside, the <strong>wooden ceilings </strong>give warmth to a space that needs, above all, to be functional and practical. </p>
<h3 class=\"title\">History of an iconic market</h3>
<p>Santa Caterina began life as a covered municipal market <strong>in 1845</strong>, on land left by the old convent of the same name, which was burned down on St James Night in 1835 during the confiscation and sale of Church lands. The idea was to give the neighbourhood a market that would supply food to the people living on this side of <strong>Ciutat Vella</strong>. Decades later, during the years following the Civil War, when food was in short supply in many places, the market became a centre for supplying neighbouring cities, such as Sant Adrià, Santa Coloma and even Mataró, from where people came by train to buy groceries.</p>
<p>Today, Santa Caterina is known for the <strong>quality and variety</strong> of its produce. Generally, it attracts fewer visitors than the Boqueria, which makes it more tranquil.</p>
<p>It stands in the middle of Ciutat Vella, in the Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera neighbourhood, one of the parts of the city with the most history.</p>

            "#text": "<h3 class=\"title\">The new market is born</h3>
<p>As the city grew and the <strong>Rambla</strong> became more important as a thoroughfare, the itinerant stalls gradually moved backwards and towards the west until they arrived at the foot of the <strong>Convent of Sant Josep</strong> (which has since disappeared and is the origin of the market&#8217;s name). Groups of rioters set fire to it in 1835, on St James&#8217; Night, which became known for the Burning of the Convents. The land it had stood on then became the property of the City Council. There the <strong>square with the porch</strong> was built that can still be seen today, and the market was finally moved indoors, even though today&#8217;s building still did not exist. The municipal architect Josep Mas was given the job of designing a <strong>tall, modern building</strong> made with cast iron to house the stalls. The Boqueria was officially opened in 1840 and the roof was finished in 1916.</p>
<h3 class=\"title\">Today</h3>
<p>The Boqueria has become a place to savour with all five senses: walking among the stalls and curious visitors, while enjoying the <strong>colours and the aromas</strong> it offers, is a real pleasure. These days there are over <strong>300 stalls</strong>, where all kinds of products are sold from Catalonia and around the world.</p>
<p>You can find everything at the market: fruit and vegetables, fish and seafood, meat, preserves, pulses, cheese and so on. There is local produce and imported food, <strong>Catalan specialities</strong> as well as world cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. <strong>Cultural and gastronomic activities</strong> are held there, including courses, workshops, tasting sessions and meetings.</p>
<p>In 2005, the Boqueria was rewarded with the <strong>Best Market of the Year Award</strong> at the sixth International Public Markets Conference, held in Washington.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The heart of the neighbourhood</h3>
<p>The Barceloneta has traditionally been the city&#8217;s fishing neighbourhood. It was built from scratch in 1753 next to the port and outside the then walled city, and welcomed a large number of citizens soon after. The marine activity of the neighbourhood saw the emergence of a market specialising in fish and shellfish, which initially consisted of outdoor stalls until the construction of a Modernist building during the later part of the 19th century.</p>
<h3>The market of the sea</h3>
<p>The building, designed by Antoni Rovira i Trias, was a comprehensive and functional space and it replaced the traditional open-air stalls. This building remained in use for a number of decades, becoming one of the neighbourhood’s <strong>vital organs, </strong>until the start of the 21st century when it became clear that it would need to be refurbished. The architect Josep Mine, a friend of the late Enric Miralles, was entrusted with the refurbishment of the market. He respected the original wrought-iron structure and the brick walls but he also installed lifts, air conditioning, sewerage, new lighting, underground floors and photovoltaic solar panels, making the market the first in Barcelona to use <strong>solar energy</strong>. There are also two restaurants and an upper level that is used for functions related to the world of food and gastronomy.</p>
<p>The market is also actively committed to sustainability, as evidenced by the plan for waste separation and recycling that it has championed, and for which it received an award from the Generalitat (regional government) of Catalonia.</p>

<p>The Sants neighbourhood is internationally renowned, thanks to the large station located between the squares of Els Països Catalans and Joan Peiró. It is the city&#8217;s <strong>main train station</strong>, and is considered to be the nerve centre of land transport in Barcelona. Outside the train station there is a <strong>bus station </strong>with the same name.<br /> Its medium and long-distance services, using both the classic and <strong>high-speed</strong> rail networks, connect Barcelona to both national and international destinations. It is also the busiest point of the Barcelona Rodalies <strong>suburban rail network</strong>, with lines R1, R2, R3 and R4 all converging here.</p>
<h3>Platforms from the past and present</h3>
<p>The history of the station dates back to the old stables of the La Bordeta neighbourhood and Sants station which entered into operation at the <strong>end of 1881</strong>. Following successive changes and business mergers, in 1967 a plan was put in place to build the station we know today. Opened in the 1970s, the materials used in its construction included <strong>steel, concrete and glass</strong>. It is a <strong>modern, functional station </strong>with numerous services and information points, and it is also home to the metro station of the same name, with access to lines 3 and 5. Its suburban rail network connects Barcelona to almost all the surrounding towns, and thousands of people use this form of transport to reach the city centre each day. The mixture of travellers, local residents and tourists creates an atmosphere of constant <strong>movement and energy</strong> which forms part of the city.</p>

This historical tramline runs all the way up <strong>Avinguda del Tibidabo</strong>, a distance of one and a half kilometres, linking Plaça J.F. Kennedy at the bottom with Plaça del Doctor Andreu at the top. The line passes between the characteristic <strong>Modernista and Noucentista mansions</strong> of this elegant avenue and takes you to the funicular station for the train that climbs Tibidabo.</p>
<h3>A landscaped avenue</h3>
<p>The Tramvia Blau was the idea of <strong>Dr Andreu</strong>, a pharmacist and very influential member of the Catalan bourgeoisie at the start of the 20th century, who wanted to turn this area into a big landscaped avenue. He was also behind the <strong>Tibidabo Amusement Park</strong>. This is the only surviving tram of this period in Barcelona that you can still use and it invites you to <strong>climb the hill</strong> and enjoy the natural surroundings as <strong>the Barcelona folk of old</strong> did, at the pace of a none-too-distant past.</p>

<p><strong>In 1906</strong> the company running the Sarrià railway line got the contract to build a funicular railway <strong>736 metres</strong> long, to link <strong>the old village of Vallvidrera</strong> with Barcelona and save having to climb up the slope between the Vallvidrera road and the village. The funicular has continued running since then, taking people up and down every day between Vallvidrera and the Peu del Funicular station.</p>
<p>It is a <strong>short journey</strong>, only lasting a few minutes, but it offers some <strong>spectacular views</strong> of the city, which get better as you climb towards Vallvidrera, now part of Barcelona. Also worthy of mention is the <strong>upper station</strong>, with its curvy lines and <strong>central European decoration</strong>, that was designed and built by the architect <strong>Bonaventura Conill</strong> in Plaça de Pep Ventura.</p>

<p>Renovated in 2007, the Montjuïc cable car is much more than a means of transport because, thanks to the <strong>privileged views </strong>it offers, it has become one of the mountain&#8217;s big attractions. It is very easy to access, as it stops at <strong>three different points </strong>along its route. The first stop, <strong>Parc de Montjuïc</strong>, is situated on Avinguda Miramar, very close to the funicular railway station that climbs up the mountainside from Paral·lel. From this point you can access some of the most important <strong>cultural attractions </strong>in the park, such as the Joan Miró Foundation, Poble Espanyol and the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC).</p>
<h3>Bird&#8217;s eye view</h3>
<p>Making the journey by cable car gives visitors the opportunity to stop at each station to enjoy everything on offer there. The second stop, Mirador, enables visitors to reach the famous <strong>Mirador de l’Alcalde</strong> vantage point, a landscaped terrace with exceptional views over the Port of Barcelona. Close by is the emblematic <strong>Monument a la Sardana</strong>, and the entrance to the <strong>Jardins de Joan Brossa</strong>. These woodland gardens are a great place to venture into with a childlike spirit, as they are home to musical cushions, zip lines and climbing games.</p>
<p>The third and final stop is <strong>Castell de Montjuïc</strong>, where you can visit this 17th century military fortress and carry on enjoying the spectacular views over a large part of the city from the mountain top.</p>
<p>From the modern cable car cabins, which hold up to 8 people, you can observe the city in motion without losing sight of important buildings such as the Sagrada Família or the Agbar Tower. The experience of gradually zooming out from the city as the cable car climbs the mountain, and the opportunity it provides to get a bird&#8217;s eye view of Barcelona is a unique experience that is well worth trying.</p>

<p>Originally, the funicular railway had a second stretch that took passengers up to the castle, but with the opening of the cable car, this stretch of the railway fell into disuse. Renovated for the first time in 1992 for the Olympic Games, it was the second renovation in 2005 which gave it the modern appearance it has today.</p>
<h3>Climbing the mountain</h3>
<p>The funicular railway operates as part of the metro network and its initial stop is in the Paral·lel metro station itself, where is connects with lines L2 and L3. The second and final stop, the Parc de Montjuïc station, is situated on the mountain, on <strong>Avinguda</strong> <strong>de Miramar</strong>, which extends to Avinguda de l’Estadi, at a height of 80 metres above sea level and is a short distance from the Montjuïc cable car. This is the location of some of the most important cultural amenities in the park, such as the Joan Miró Foundation, the Palau Sant Jordi and the Olympic Stadium. The journey is a real pleasure.</p>

<p>Frederic Correa and Alfons Milà i Sagnier were school friends since they were ten years old and both got their degrees in architecture from the University of Barcelona. In 1953 they opened an <strong>architecture office together</strong>, and as well as Torre Atalaya they co-designed Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>Olympic Ring</strong> and the interior of Restaurant Reno (1961), among many other works.</p>
<p>Inspired by the <strong>Modern Movement, </strong>with such masters as Josep Antoni Coderch, with whom they collaborated for many years, their work is an interpretation of the architectural heritage of the <strong>great Catalan masters</strong>, and has led to its own movement.</p>
<h3>The barcelona school</h3>
<p>The Atalaya is one of the most characteristic buildings of the so-called <strong>Escola de Barcelona</strong>,  or Barcelona school, an architectural movement developed in Catalonia between 1960 and 1970. The movement is characterised by austerity and elegance and gives a nod to northern Italian architecture from the 1950s and 60s. The common stylistic stamp is the search for structure and logic, simple lines and innovative shapes, with emphasis on interior design and the urban planning surrounding the buildings.</p>

<p>The successor to the 1401 hospital in the Raval neighbourhood, <strong>Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau</strong> was created at the end of the 19th century by the architect <strong>Lluís Domènech i Montaner</strong>. Both as a health facility and for its architectural value, it is one of the most extraordinary Modernista sites in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Considered to be the largest <strong>Modernista complex</strong> of Catalan architecture, it was declared a UNESCO <strong>World Heritage</strong> site in 1997. The 12 Gothic Revival-inspired buildings are covered in ceramics and a <strong>wide variety of prized iconography</strong> revealing the creator&#8217;s religious sentiments. The general criteria followed in the construction of these <strong>12 buildings</strong> were common structures,  lighting, ventilation and room decoration.</p>
<h3>Heritage waiting to be discovered</h3>
<p>In 2009, after the Modernista complex had been used as a health centre for more than eight decades, an <strong>ambitious project</strong> moved the hospital to new  facilities at the northern edge of the site, and the historic pavilions were converted into a research and <strong>historical culture</strong> centre.</p>
<p>A place of memories, the Modernista complex currently houses a <strong>research and knowledge centre </strong>comprising institutes linked to health, education and health-related activities. In addition, the administration pavilion contains the <strong>Historical Archives</strong> of the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, one of the oldest documentary resources in Europe, with documents from the 15th century, when the hospital was in the Raval neighbourhood, right up to the 20th century. As a base for cultural and educational events,  Hospital de Sant Pau is a <strong>unique place to visit</strong> that that takes you through decades of Barcelona&#8217;s science, history and architecture.</p>

<p>Attached to Casa Batlló, Casa Amatller ;was built by Josep Puig i Cadafalch, one of Antoni Gaudí&#8217;s greatest rivals at the start of the 20th century. The fact that they are touching each other and both are impressive houses, very near Casa Lleó Morera and other magnificent Modernista houses, means this area in the middle of Passeig de Gràcia is still known as the <strong><em>block </em></strong><em><strong>of discord</strong></em>.</p>
<p> The house was built between 1898 and 1900, for the <strong>chocolatier Antoni Amatller</strong> at the time when the Eixample had just opened and bourgeois families from throughout the city decided to adopt <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> as their own residential area.</p>
<h3>A Flemish house</h3>
<p>The building is inspired by 17th century Dutch houses , with a <strong>typically Flemish facade</strong> covered in triangular-shaped ceramics and flat at the top. The lower facade and entrance are decorated with <strong>sculptures by Eusebi Arnau </strong>with typical Catalan motifs, such as Sant Jordi (St George) slaying the dragon, and also in honour of the chocolatier owner, including family surnames and references to his trade.</p>
<p> Apart from being a chocolatier, Amatller was also a photography enthusiast, and his daughter converted the family home into an art centre, the <strong>Institut</strong> Amatller d’Art Hispànic. A selection from her father&#8217;s vast collections is on display on the ground floor.</p>

<p>Built at the <strong>end of the 19th century</strong> for the textile trader Pere Màrtir Calvet, who used part of the building for his business and another as a residence, Casa Calvet is considered by experts as the most conservative work by <strong>the architect Antoni Gaudí</strong>. Since 1994, it is also a well-known restaurant of <strong>Mediterranean cuisine</strong> run by the chef Miquel Alija.</p>
<p>Casa Calvet is located in Carrer Casp, very near Plaça Urquinaona. It is the first of three houses which Antoni Gaudí designed in the <strong>Eixample</strong>.Its <strong>Baroque style</strong> gives it an unusual, austere look and marks a <strong>time of transition</strong> between two stages in the architect&#8217;s career: the first, when he still made personal reinterpretations of different historical styles, and the second, when he showed that he was free from any conditioning factor.</p>
<p>Winner of the annual best building award granted by <strong>Barcelona City Council</strong> in 1900,Casa Calvet stands out for the facade on which Gaudí worked with <strong>Lluís Badia</strong> on the <strong>wrought iron</strong> balconies, and the carpenter Casas i Barde on the woodwork. Built in <strong>dressed stone from Montjuïc</strong>, it is decorated with structures of <strong>religious busts</strong> of Sant Pere Màrtir and the saints of Calvet&#8217;s home town. The main gallery is also profusely decorated with an olive tree as a symbol of peace, a cypress tree as a symbol of hospitality, and the shield of Catalonia.</p>
<h3>Modernista touches</h3>
<p>In spite of its Baroque style,<strong>Modernista features</strong> can be seen on the facade, in the curved shape of the <strong>iron balconies</strong>, the glass balcony which overhangs the entrance and the <strong>columns in the shape of bobbins</strong> which flank the entrance in an allusion to the trader&#8217;s profession.</p>
<p> The <strong>first work by Gaudí in the Eixample</strong> is a unique testimony to his work, which enables you to observe and delight in the<strong> evolution </strong>of his <strong>architecture</strong> over time, and also, if you have the chance,to taste the delicious Mediterranean cuisine.</p>

<p>Despite having some straight lines that have no part in the sinuous curves of <strong>Gaudiesque architecture</strong>, there is no doubting that Bellesguard House is one of the best examples of architectural innovation by the master architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>. Jaume Figueres, a businessman and close friend of Gaudí&#8217;s, wanted to build a house for his family in a unique setting with lots of political significance. So he chose a place in Collserola, where there were the <strong>remains of a medieval castle</strong> that belonged to King Martín the Humane but which, in the 18th century, was home to the highwayman Serrallonga.</p>
<h3>Modernista castle</h3>
<p>Gaudí, impressed by the history of this spot, designed a house inspired by the old castle with some very straight lines, and he made the most of the remains to design the garden of the estate. The result is an <strong>impressive mansion</strong> that resembles a castle with its merlons but has a lot of Gaudiesque touches, such as the use of wrought iron, ceramic mosaic benches, large, colourful glazed windows and brick friezes, as well as a detail that does not escape the curious eye of visitors: the ivy-shaped pipes.</p>
<p>Bellesguard, declared a <strong>Property of Cultural Interest</strong> in 1969, is now open for guided tours, so you can enjoy the majesty of its rooms, the tranquility of its gardens and the spectacular views but, above all, so you can admire close up, one of Gaudí&#8217;s treasures, perhaps the one most hidden from view.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>The budding of a genius</h3>
<p>In 1883, the entrepreneur Manel Vicens contacted <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, a young, unknown architect who had just obtained his degree, and asked him to build a summer residence in the <strong>town of Gràcia</strong>. The chosen site was on <strong>Carrer de les Carolines</strong>, next to the convent.</p>
<p>Gaudí designed a building with <strong>Arabic, Mudejar and oriental</strong> elements, in which straight lines took prominence over the architect&#8217;s famous undulating lines, although some of the features that were so typical of his style were then starting to be seen.</p>
<h3>Gaudinian spirit</h3>
<p>Casa Vicens is covered with <strong>green and white tiles</strong> that have yellowish details imitating the carnations that grew in the garden; the entrance doors are made of <strong>cast iron and filigree</strong> and reminiscent of palm leaves; and the arcades, latticework and use of masonry conjure up memories of the Alhambra. Gaudí&#8217;s love of nature starts to be visible, and one can go on a <strong>treasure hunt</strong> to find the phrases, taken from children&#8217;s stories, bordering the friezes inside the house. It is said and in fact, reflected in the original plans of the house, that there was once a fountain in the garden in which the water created a permanent rainbow-like effect, but that fountain no longer exists. Only a genius like Gaudí could have planned such a fountain.</p>
<p>The spectacular Casa Vicens, with its glazed tiles that adorn the facades and its oriental air, was classified as a <strong>UNESCO heritage site </strong>in 2005 and is one of the first works by the unique Antoni Gaudí, in which the characteristics that would make him one of the most original architects ever can still be seen.</p>

<p>In the final third of the <strong>19th century</strong>, universal expositions, or world trade fairs, were events that had an enormous social impact because they introduced the host city to the whole world, along with the cultural, economic, scientific and industrial potential of each country. So the Triumphal Arch was not only the entrance to the <strong>Universal</strong> <strong>Exposition of 1888</strong>, it also symbolically marked Barcelona&#8217;s entry into the <strong>modern era</strong>.</p>
<p>From an urban development perspective, the Arc de Triomf stands on the edge of <strong>Ciutat Vella</strong>, the old city that spreads out to the south, and modern Barcelona outside the old walls to the north, the E<strong>ixample</strong> neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>Modernista spirit</h3>
<p>At the height of the <strong>Modernista or Art Nouveau</strong> <strong>movement</strong> in a large part of Europe, it was common to see constructions reflecting a historicist trend, that is, one inspired by previous eras. Neo-Gothic, Neo-Mudéjar (at least in Spain) and Neo-Romantic were some of the predominant styles.</p>
<p>In line with this trend, the architect <strong>Josep Vilaseca</strong> drew up plans for a monument 30 metres high, of classical proportions, but very attractive and highly <strong>symbolic</strong>. The artists who sculpted the decorative friezes portrayed a city-related theme on each side: <em>Barcelona welcomes the nations</em> (on the Passeig de Sant Joan face, by Josep Reynés), <em>Sharing the rewards among the participants of the Exposition </em>(on the Passeig de Lluís Companys face, by Josep Llimona) and allegories of Industry, Agriculture and Trade on one side, and Science and Art on the other. Les Fames (the winged figures on the buttresses) were sculpted by Manuel Fuxà and Pere Carbonell.</p>
<p>Finally, you can see the <strong>Barcelona coat of arms </strong>on the curve of the arch, flanked by those of the other 48 Spanish provinces, 24 on each face of the monument.</p>

<p>The origins of the Universitat de Barcelona date back to the <strong>15th century</strong>, when King Alfonso the Magnanimous founded the Estudi General de Barcelona. The university was a very active and very important education centre under the Crown of Aragon until 1714 when, as a result of the <strong>War of Succession,</strong> it was suppressed. In 1838, when at last it could return to the city, it was initially housed in a convent on Carrer del Carme, but the need was immediately seen for a new building.</p>
<p>The project was carried out by the Catalan architect <strong>Elies Rogent</strong> and the site finally chosen to locate the building was in the Eixample, the new part of the city that had just been planned. Construction started in 1862, but it was not completely finished until 1892-93, although classes started in 1871 and it was officially opened in 1874.</p>
<h3>Places of peace and study</h3>
<p>The result was this magnificent <strong>Neoromantic building</strong>, with a facade of 129 metres running along the Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, with a raised main building in the centre, and a building on either side. The right-hand building was for science and the left-hand building for the arts.</p>
<p>The central building is entered through a hall with an impressive staircase of honour, which leads to the assembly hall. This is where the Saló de Graus is found, the most emblematic part of the building, with its exuberant decoration in Moorish and Plateresque style. The side buildings hide the <strong>cloisters</strong> with fruit trees and fountains where <strong>silence and calm prevail</strong>.At the back of the building there is a green area known as the <strong>Ferran Soldevila Garden</strong>, as a tribute to this Barcelona historian.It is a little-known, unique place to <strong>relax </strong>and escape from the outside world for a moment.In summer, the university organises various <strong>outdoor events</strong> there, including talks and concerts.</p>
<p>Today, the University of Barcelona is considered to be the best <strong>university research centre</strong> on the Iberian peninsula, for the number of excellent programmes it has achieved in this field.The various university departments are located at different points round the city: Raval,Zona Universitària, Mundet and Bellvitge, plus the <strong>historical centre</strong> in the Eixample,which is still used today for Philology, Literary Studies and Mathematics, and continues to be one of the most <strong>emblematic</strong> institutions of the city, governing most of its cultural life.</p>

<h3>A Catalan civil Baroque gem</h3>
<p>What makes this mansion on the <strong> Rambla</strong> (next to <strong>C/ Carme</strong>) <strong>so unique is its architecture, whose style is somewhat unusual in Barcelona. It was built at the end of the </strong>18th century by the then Viceroy of Perú, the <strong>Marquis of Castellbell</strong>, and became the residence of his widow, hence its name. This Barcelona residence of the Viceroy, with a style somewhere between Baroque and Rococo, was declared a national monument in 1941 by the Spanish state. It is worth spending a moment contemplating the building itself, starting with its <strong>façade, which is decorated with balconies and pillars </strong>and crowned by an imposing 12-vase balustrade. Rising from the shady courtyard are two majestic staircases, one on either side, which ascend to the main floor of the palace, where temporary exhibitions are held.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A long history</h3>
<p>In 1401, in the presence of King Martin the Humane, the first stones were laid of the Hospital de la Santa Creu, which was to become the largest hospital centre in Barcelona. In fact, it was built with the idea of bringing the city&#8217;s six existing hospitals together into a single location. The first stage was completed <strong>in 1414</strong> and the hospital started working while the other stages were being carried out.</p>
<p>A century later and the complex was practically finished. Further modifications were made in the 16th century, such as the addition of the two monumental staircases and the plateresque-style door on Carrer de l’Hospital, which became the main entrance. Drinking water was piped there too. In the 17th century another building was attached, namely the <strong>Casa de Convalescència</strong> convalescent home (the building at the northern end, adjacent to Carrer del Carme) and, in the following century a surgery college, the <strong>Col·legi de Cirurgia</strong>, was built.</p>
<h3><strong>From King Martin to the architect Gaudí </strong></h3>
<p>By the end of the 19th century the hospital complex could not provide care for the ever more populous city, nor was it able to adapt to the dynamics of modern medicine. Consequently it was agreed to move it to the newly built Hospital de Sant Pau. After five centuries of medical service, the old hospital closed in 1926, the same year that a seriously injured Antoni Gaudí was admitted and died. He was one of its last patients.</p>
<p>Today, the old Santa Creu Hospital is regarded as one of the most important <strong>civil Catalan Gothic</strong> sites, and its various buildings continue to serve the city. They house the national library, the Biblioteca de Catalunya, as well as the Institut d’Estudis Catalans (IEC &#8211; Institute of Catalan Studies), the Royal Academy of Pharmacy and the Academy of Medicine, with its <strong>anatomical amphitheatre</strong>, a dissecting table that can be visited and which dates from the <strong>18th century</strong>. There is also a school, a theatre, a contemporary art centre and, in the middle of the courtyard, a fountain with a jet where an egg dances, L&#8217;ou com balla, to celebrate the festival of Corpus Christi.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>A monastery that dates back more than a thousand years</h3>
<p>The history of the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp is shrouded in mystery due to its age. Situated on the edge of the <strong>Rambla del</strong><strong> Raval</strong>, it now finds itself in one of the busiest areas of the neighbourhood and attracts attention because of its rural, rustic appearance. </p>
<p>Its precise origins are unknown although, thanks to the tombstone of <strong>Count Guifré</strong>Borrell discovered in the 16th century, it is supposed that, when he died in the year 911, the monastery already existed and was established as a prestigious place to bury a member of the <strong>House of Barcelona</strong>. Built in the era when Raval was outside the city&#8217;s wall, its name betrays its origins as a monastery situated in a rural setting.</p>
<h3>Where past and present merge</h3>
<p>Originally considered to be a Visigothic-style construction due to the pre-Romanesque elements found on the door, the monastery is comprised of a single nave with a cross-shaped floor plan and inside it has a tympanum featuring the image of Jesus with the apostles Peter and Paul. The Romanesque-style exterior of the building is decorated with stone slabs featuring fantastical creatures and human faces.  To the south of the monastery is the <strong>small cloister </strong>featuring lobular arches and a variety of columns and capitals where you can go for a walk and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the neighbourhood. The monastery is surrounded by <strong>gardens </strong>of the same name featuring <strong>large lawns </strong>that create a unique and relaxing green space. The monastery forms part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, an initiative that aims to provide everyone with access to the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>

<p>The Llotja School has two campuses located in the neighbourhoods of San Andreu and Sarrià. It offers a huge range of intermediate and advanced-level <strong>vocational training courses</strong>, as well as Masters courses focused on the<strong>graphic and design arts </strong>and including four specialities: graphic design, interior design, fashion and product design.</p>
<h3>The History of the Llotja or a Country&#8217;s Art</h3>
<p>Although this school seems radically modern, it has a <strong>long tradition </strong>beginning back in the <strong>18th century, </strong>making it the oldest design school in Spain and one of the oldest in Europe. It was set up in 1775 by Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>Junta Particular de Comerç, </strong>the Chamber of Commerce, and the first classrooms were located on the top floor of the <strong>Llotja de Mar </strong>stock exchange, from where it takes its name.</p>
<p>When the school was founded in the eighteenth century, for lack of a better place, the Barcelona Board of Commerce decided to install the drawing classrooms in the Llotja (market) building located in the Pla de Palau, so the school adopted the name of its first home. The aim was to train <strong>artists</strong> to design patterns for the textile industry, but the school soon grew and it extended its study subjects to other areas. This is how it became the most important producer of artists in Catalonia: <strong>Marià Fortuny</strong>, <strong>Damià Campeny</strong>, <strong>Lola Anglada</strong>, <strong>Joaquim Mir</strong>, <strong>Joan Miró</strong>, <strong>Mercè Llimona</strong> and <strong>Apel·les Mestres</strong> all spent time in its classrooms, as did artists from other places including <strong>Pablo Picasso</strong>, who studied painting there before leaving for Paris.</p>
<p>Currently La Llotja produces hugely important designers, illustrators and other plastic artists who each day contributes to increasing the prestige of this institution.</p>

<p>Vil·la Joana is a very imposing old farmhouse that was built in the 18th century and later turned into a <strong>Neoclassical-style</strong> residence. It stands on <strong>Carretera de l’Església</strong>, in the natural surroundings of <strong>Parc de Collserola</strong>. The fact that it was in these hills and had belonged to a friend of Jacint Verdaguer&#8217;s, Ramon Miralles, is the reason the poet, afflicted by tuberculosis, decided to spend the final years of his life there.</p>
<p>The leading figure in the <strong>Catalan Renaissance</strong> died in Vil·la Joana in 1902 and, since then, the house has preserved the essence of his time there, leaving the rooms he occupied as they were.</p>
<h3>In memory of the poet</h3>
<p>Some time after his death, Barcelona City Council bought Vil·la Joana from its former owners. Initially it was turned into a pioneering school but late it became a house museum, the <strong>Museu-Casa Verdaguer</strong>. Now a city history museum (MUHBA) heritage site, it is currently being remodelled and only the ground floor remains open.</p>
<p>Until the exhibition re-opens, it will not be possible to see again the <strong>numerous reminders</strong> of the author of <em>Canigó</em> and <em>Atlàntida</em>, such as his writing desk, his office and his bedroom, in the house gallery. Despite that, the avenue through the estate offers a chance to discover the vegetation that inspired Verdaguer, who was an expert on plants and trees, and enjoy the natural poetry away from the noise of the city.</p>

To implement it, the Catalan Ministry of Health set up a public company called Parc Sanitari Pere Virgili. Since then, the company has been <strong>combining forces </strong>to optimise the use of the 53,064 square metres the site has at its disposal, a <strong>reserve of physical resources </strong>for implementing public policies.</p>

<h3>The name Pere Virgili</h3>
<p>Pere Virgili was a <strong>doctor and scientist</strong> who was born in Vilallonga del Camp in 1699. He was the Surgeon-Major of the Army and the Navy, and played a decisive role in Spanish surgery at the time. Regarded as an innovator and the <strong>creator of surgery studies </strong>on the Iberian Peninsula, he founded the Cádiz and Barcelona colleges of surgery in 1748 and 1768 respectively.</p>

<p>The Sant Genís dels Agudells complex is made up of a church, rectory and parish cemetery, where <strong>Manuel Carrasco i Formiguera</strong> is buried, and the 13TH-CENTURY farmhouse of Can Safont. The church has a single nave with <strong>a transept, chapels and a lintelled door</strong>. A fire damaged the parish church, burning a good part of its interior, at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936. Its characteristic bell tower dates from the 17th century. The  <strong>Can Safont farmhouse</strong> has been rebuilt many times, however, and has lost its original appearance. In contrast, the rectory still maintains the worked stone on the windows and door, along with a semicircular arch. The facade of the church preserves a sculptured <strong>Gothic cross</strong>.</p>
<h3>A cemetery in use</h3>
<p>Boasting some <strong>thousand niches</strong>, the cemetery still holds burials. Only two cemeteries remain in Barcelona that are not municipally owned: this is one of them and the other is the Vallvidrera.</p>

A <strong>Romanesque church </strong>was consecrated on the same site in 1314, and in 1347 it was rebuilt as a Gothic church that housed the famous <strong>Sant Vicenç altarpiece</strong>, which is now kept in the <strong>National Art Museum of Catalonia</strong>, the MNAC. The Baroque <strong>polychrome, carved wooden </strong>altar dedicated to Mare de Déu del Roser (Our Lady of the Rosary), which can still be seen at the church, was made by Aguste Pool. The present-day, <strong>Neoclassical church</strong>, was designed by Josep Mas in 1781.</p>
<h3>An interior full of art</h3>
<p>The new church has a single nave with <strong>intercommunicating side chapels</strong>. The transept is covered by a dome. Another outstanding feature is its <strong>graceful octagonal bell tower</strong>. The interior is full of works of art from different styles and periods, such as the Noucentista <strong>mural fresco paintings</strong>. Other outstanding works in this quintessential Sarrià church include the 17th century altarpiece from the <strong>old Santa Clara</strong> <strong>convent</strong>, and Adrià Gual&#8217;s altar paintings dedicated to Mare de Déu de Montserrat (Our Lady of Montserrat).</p>

<p>With the distinction of having been the first club to inspire a love of tennis in Spain, the <strong>Reial Club de Tennis Barcelona </strong>is today a highly prestigious institution. With <strong>over one hundred years of history</strong>, it has been the setting for many an exciting moment in the history of the sport. <strong>Forty-five Davis Cup</strong> <strong>preliminaries</strong> have been held at the club&#8217;s facilities, where players of the calibre of <strong>Conchita Martinez, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario </strong>and <strong>Carles Moya</strong> have trained, as has one of the greatest champions in history, <strong>Rafael Nadal</strong>, among others.</p>
<h3>Historical Background</h3>
<p>Founded by <strong>several English families in 1899</strong>, the Reial Club de Tennis Barcelona was a <strong>pioneering club</strong> that enjoyed its heyday in the 1950s with the creation of the <strong>Comte de Godó Trophy</strong> and the Davis Cup triumphs on the legendary <strong>Talisman Court</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>current building&#8217;s base</strong> dates back to <strong>medieval times</strong> and only a few <strong>windows with ogee arches</strong> have been preserved, resting <strong>above a few sculpted capitals, typical of Catalan Gothic.</strong> The building’s general structure is the result of several extensions carried out in the 17th century, a period when the property passed into the hands of the Canet family, after whom the farm is named. It was acquired by the Barcelona Royal Tennis Club in 1954, which then revamped the whole building and redeveloped and adapted the farm for new social uses. It also remodelled its agricultural fields to make them suitable for playing tennis on. The club facilities in the <strong>Pedralbes neighbourhood</strong> offer a range of options, including learning to <strong>play tennis and paddle tennis</strong>, attending competitions, swimming in the pool and, above all, <strong>enjoying the pleasure of sport </strong>in a unique environment.</p>

<p>The Royal Monastery of Santa Maria de Pedralbes is one of the most representative and valuable examples of <strong>Gothic architecture </strong>in Barcelona. Founded in 1327 by Queen Elisenda of Montcada to support the Clarissa Nuns, it was opened to the public in 1983 as a <strong>museum and place of cultural interest</strong>. Today, one of the monastery&#8217;s main attractions is the insight the museum provides into the <strong>everyday lives </strong>of the community of Clarissa nuns, where you can even walk through their dormitories, the refectory and other rooms.</p>
<h3>Medieval splendour</h3>
<p>The monastery buildings, which have been declared a <strong>site of national historical interest</strong>, form a small redoubt in the city that maintains a rural feel. The single-nave <strong>church </strong>houses the tomb of Queen Elisenda, featuring a reclining statue that depicts her sleeping peacefully. The three-storey high cloister, around which the monastery is built, is believed to be the <strong>largest Gothic cloister in the world</strong>, and boasts the beautiful <strong>medieval garden </strong>where medicinal herbs are grown. The monastery, one of the best examples of Gothic architecture in Catalonia, enables all those who wish to, to discover its history and enjoy a mystical setting in the city.</p>

<p>Despite being damaged by a fire during the events of Tragic Week in 1909, Gaudí&#8217;s mosaic, which was designed between 1879 and 1881, was restored in 1988 and continues to be <strong>conserved</strong>. Gaudí designed other elements for the church, such as the high altar (destroyed by the fire) <strong>the choir and lights</strong>, currently conserved by the Congregació de Jesús i Maria in Sant Gervasi.</p>
<h3>Gaudí, the disciple</h3>
<p>The mosaic decorates the church&#8217;s central corridor and transept. Sant Andreu&#8217;s municipal architect Joan Torras Guardiola designed the church in 1879. At the time it was the chapel of the <strong>convent </strong>of the Congregació de Josep i Maria nuns, hence the letters J and M in the mosaic. Antoni Gaudí had been his disciple and the architect commissioned him with designing the mosaic.</p>

<p>Hospital Clínic is made up of <strong>11 centres and institutes</strong> organised according to their speciality. Healthcare includes primary care, hospital care, public and private care, the mental health unit and the transplant unit. Besides the <strong>main hospital centre</strong>, it also includes the Maternity Hospital complex and other centres.</p>
<p>On numerous occasions the hospital has been the setting for <strong>pioneering operations</strong> in Spain, such as the first kidney transplant in the country in 1965, the first bone marrow transplant in 1976, and the first kidney and pancreas transplant in 1983. Innovation is one of its basic principles and in 2014, for example, it introduced a minimally invasive technique for heart failure operations. Some of the outstanding physicians in contemporary Catalan medicine, such as <strong>Moisès Broggi </strong>and Josep Maria Gil-Vernet, have worked at the hospital.</p>
<h3>The complex</h3>
<p>The building, which took 11 years to complete (1895 to 1906), was designed by Ignasi C. Bartrolí and based on the <strong>classicist trend</strong> of the time. An example of this style is the facade on Carrer de Casanova, the main entrance to the <strong>Faculty of Medicine</strong>, with its imposing portico supported by classical columns and a pediment with allegorical reliefs of Greek and Latin inspiration.</p>

<p>In the early 20th century, a group of journalists and residents of the neighbourhood created a residents association aimed at discussing the urbanisation of the Font d’en Fargues neighbourhood and stimulating its <strong>social and recreational activities</strong>. They set up its Centre in the Casino, built in 1928 under the supervision of the <strong>Noucentista architect Adolf Florensa</strong> on land ceded to the association by its owners, Mateu Rovira and Concepció Ribó. The residents association operated as a <strong>recreational and cultural cooperative:</strong> it was a facility open to the neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>From casino to parish social centre</h3>
<p>The building consisted of a café and a <strong>theatre,</strong> but its services grew over the years thanks to the contributions of the members and residents themselves. During the post-war period, the Casino survived a great deal of problems, but was finally sold. Some years later is was bought by the parish, which founded the <strong>San Antonio de Padua Family Centre </strong>there. It currently belongs to the City Council and is managed by the Associació Casal Font d’en Fargues, expressly created to maintain the spirit with which it was opened that of promoting recreational, social, artistic and educational activities.</p>

<p>Designed by the architects Bonell, Barberà, Canosa, Gil i Rius, the new Hospital de Sant Pau building <strong>is shaped like a hand</strong>: the main 36,000 square-metre block houses the outpatients service. Each of the fingers, devoted to hospital blocks, add up to a total of nearly 47,000 square metres. Every year this top hospital attends to almost 35,000 inpatients and over 145,000 emergencies. The outpatients service attends to almost 35,000 people a year and the day hospital has 75,000 users. It has 136 day hospital points, 644 beds and 21 surgeons.</p>
<h3>Research centre</h3>
<p>This centre also includes teaching activity. It belongs to the <strong>UAB&#8217;s Medical Faculty</strong> and the University Nursing School. The research carried out is another of its hallmarks: 2009 saw the creation of the Sant Pau<strong> Biomedical Research Institute</strong>, which publishes many works of research. The centre is run by the Foundation Board of Health Management, formed by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, the City Council and the Archdiocese of Barcelona.</p>

<h3>A hundred-year history</h3>
<p>Back in <strong>1902</strong>, a group of sports enthusiasts founded the club. Based on the Club Social La Salut, which had been set up in 1899. The original name was Salut Sport Club<i> </i>and, besides tennis, football was played there initially. In fact, when some FC Barcelona players left their club in 1911 to found Casual SC, they established their headquarters at the Salut Sport Club. The Club Tennis de la Salut received the <strong>Creu de Sant Jordi</strong> (St George&#8217;s Cross) in 2002 for a history that has turned it into Catalonia&#8217;s number two tennis club.</p>

<p>In 1626, Carmelite friars settled in what was then an unpopulated area and they founded the convent of<strong> Santa Maria de Gràcia</strong>. Construction work on the monastery was completed in 1630 but work did not begin on the church until 1658, and it was consecrated in 1687. The temple was built by Brother José de la Concepción following the traditional canons of the Catalan Baroque, while the <strong>three-tiered façade</strong> topped with a triangular pediment is common in Carmelite churches of the period.</p>
<h3>The beginnings of a neighbourhood</h3>
<p>The Josepets church witnessed the growth of an entire village that ultimately took its name. By association with the Santa Maria de Gràcia convent, the village was also called Santa Maria de Gràcia (or Virgin of Gràcia or Our Lady of Gràcia), which was later shortened to just Gràcia. As a further reference to the Virgin, the district’s coat of arms features the Marian symbol of <strong>three white lilies </strong>on a blue background.</p>
<p>The church has always had close ties to the community, and apart from its religious activity, the parish is linked to several associations including the <strong>Esplai Josepets </strong>leisure centre</p>

<p>There are buildings that invite you to take a look through the various artistic movements that have influenced the city, and the Church of El Remei is one such. Built in a <strong>mixture of</strong> <strong>different styles</strong>,hereyou can find a Neo-Romanesque doorway, a Neo-Gothic rosette and even a Neo-Classical cornice. The most historicist and, probably, most striking element is the bell tower, which was built by <strong>Antoni Rovira i Rabassa</strong> in 1897 and is crowned by an <strong>iron dome</strong> from which the bells hang. </p>
<h3>Local identity</h3>
<p>The building stands in iconic <strong>Plaça de la Concòrdia</strong>, which is one of the district’s liveliest squares and one that, along with the church itself, evokes a time when <strong>Les Corts</strong> was an independent township from the city of Barcelona.</p>
<p>The church was designed by <strong>Josep Oriol Mestres i Esplugues</strong> between 1846 and 1849 and remains the principal place of worship in the neighbourhood to this day. The Feast (“<strong><em>festa major</em></strong>”) of La Mare de Déu del Remei, or Our Lady of Remedy, <strong>patron saint of Les Corts</strong> and one of the most venerated manifestations of Our Lady in Catalonia, takes place in early October, when the streets are decorated ready for these celebrations. </p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s polo club, the Reial Club de Polo, was founded in 1897 by a group of players led by <strong>Enrique Ibarrola</strong>. Originally, the field was the former <strong>Can Tunis race track</strong>. A few years later the club moved to Sarrià and merged with the <strong>Barcelona Hockey Club</strong>. At the beginning of the 20th century, the club strengthened its tennis and hockey to the point that many members of the Spanish hockey squad came from the Reial Club. In fact, <strong>some sixty players </strong>from Barcelona&#8217;s polo club have played in various <strong>Olympic Games</strong> throughout history.</p>
<h3>Olympic facilities</h3>
<p>In 1932, the sports club moved to its new, and current home on Avinguda Diagonal and it has not stopped growing. In the 1990s it expanded its sporting offer to include a <strong>section for padel tennis</strong>. During the <strong>Olympic Games in 1992</strong>, the club&#8217;s completely renovated facilities hosted the <strong>horse trials</strong>.</p>

A century later, the hospital covered practically every medical and surgical speciality, standing out as a <strong>pioneering centre for health care, training and research</strong>.</p>
<p>Following its extension in 2008, its present-day latest-generation technical equipment and exceptional human team enable it to provide quality health care and develop research programmes centred on the <strong>medicine of the future</strong>.</p>
<p>Providing health care services for residents in Barcelona&#8217;s two maritime districts &#8211; <strong>Ciutat Vella</strong> and <strong>Sant Martí</strong>, Hospital del Mar is a vital organ for the city and a benchmark hospital for the country.</p>
<h3>Teamwork</h3>
<p>Hospital del Mar is part of <strong>Parc de Salut Mar</strong>, an organisation that integrates all levels of social and health care. It includes Hospital de l’Esperança, Centre Fòrum, the IMIM (Institut Hospital del Mar for Medical Research) and the Mar Higher School of Nursing.</p>

The club also prepares various teams and individuals for sports competitions, including the <strong>Olympic swimming championship</strong>.</p>
<p>The CNB also founded the popular <strong>Copa Nadal</strong>, which involves an annual swimming across 200 metres of open water in Barcelona&#8217;s port on Christmas Day, an event that has been held for more than a century!</p>
<h3>In the wake of Bernat Picornell</h3>
<p>Swimming as a sport was introduced to in Catalonia by the swimmer Bernat Picornell, who dedicated his life to promoting this sport and founded the CNB together with a group of friends. The club has continued to grow ever since: to mark the foundation&#8217;s centenary in 2007, the CNB was presented with the <strong>St George&#8217;s Cross</strong>.</p>

<p>Just a few minutes from the cathedral, you will find a <strong>vibrant and multicultural neighbourhood</strong> that is buzzing with activity. This area has a wide variety of small restaurants, shops, studios and terraces, to which people of all imaginable professions from all over have come and where they coexist in harmony. Workers, poets and anarchists, humble as well as powerful people, musicians, thieves and even bandits such as Joan de Serrallongan have lived in the neighbourhood of Sant Pere in days gone by.</p>
<p>This all began back in the 10th century when the foundation of the monastery of Sant Pere de les Puel·les saw the arrival of people from all parts and these people then settled in the vicinity. A <strong>villa extramuros</strong> (a town outside the walls) had already existed there in the 12th century, and at the end of the 13th century it was included inside the new city walls.</p>
<p>The convent was demolished in 1873 and the religious community moved to Sarrià, where it still remains to this day. The neighbourhood was then left with only one church.</p>
<h3>The refurbished church</h3>
<p>The stone wall that we can see from the plaza is evidence of the <strong>thousand and one changes</strong> that this church has undergone over the years. While the portal is from the 15th century, many other elements have been lost and others were added at later stages: the original floor in the shape of a Greek cross was modified in one subsequent reform, the apse was also replaced, and a bell tower was built in the fifteenth century only to be replaced years later. In 1911, the church was rebuilt following a fire but it burnt down again during the Civil War before finally being restored again in 1945, giving it the <strong>eclectic appearance</strong> that it has today. In spite of all these changes, we can still see some traces of the church’s Romanesque origins in the interior, and its exterior appearance with its imposing portal reminds us that this was the birthplace of a great medieval district. </p>

            "#text": "<h3>From Gothic to avant garde</h3>
<p>The Museu Picasso de Barcelona houses 4,249 works in the permanent collection and is fundamental if you want to get to know the painter&#8217;s youthful and formative years. The museum occupies <strong>five palaces in Carrer Montcada </strong>that constitute one of the best examples of civil Catalan Gothic architecture. They have a common structure, around an internal courtyard and a grand external staircase which grants access to them. In fact, the whole of Carrer Montcada is classified as a <strong>historical and artistic monument</strong>.</p>
<p>The Museu Picasso symbolises the love affair between the city of Barcelona and the painter. The <strong>Ruiz Picasso family</strong> came to Barcelona at the end of the 19th century, when Pablo was only 14.14 Immediately he started studying at the <strong>Escola de Belles Arts de la Llotja</strong> fine arts academy and began his career as a painter. 18 When he was 18, he experienced the opening of the <strong>Quatre Gats cafe</strong>, which became one of the Catalan intellectual centres of that time. The young Picasso painted the cafe&#8217;s menus in exchange for holding an exhibition there.</p>
<h3>Picasso’s Barcelona</h3>
<p>The first years of Picasso&#8217;s training were fundamental to his artistic career, and he always kept his link with Barcelona. So much so that, by express wish of the artist, and thanks to the help of his secretary and friend Jaume Sabartés, it was decided that the city should permanently house a museum of <strong>his work as a young man</strong>. Pablo Picasso himself donated the series <em>Las Meninas de Velázquez</em> to the museum, one of his best-known and most important works.</p>
<p>Carrer Montcada, a vestige of noble Barcelona from another time, was the place chosen for the museum, and the collection was established in the <strong>Gothic Aguilar palace</strong> in 1963. The subsequent increase in the picture collection led it to occupy, in different years, the Baró de Castellet, Meca and Finestres palaces, and the Casa Mauri.</p>
<p>The museum is in the <strong>La Ribera</strong> neighbourhood in the Ciutat Vella district, where the painter also had his <strong>first workshops</strong>. Very close to the Quatre Gats and La Llotja, there are settings that were crucial in Pablo Picasso&#8217;s artistic training and development.</p>
<p>The love affair between Barcelona and Picasso never ended. In Ciutat Vella he left friends, relationships and drawings, and, by his own choice, one of the best museums of his work.</p>

            "#text": "<h3>An exceptional building</h3>
<p>Very close to the cathedral, the Museu Marès is housed in part of the <strong>Palau Reial Major</strong>, which had been the residence of the counts of Barcelona and the kings of the Crown of Aragon and Catalonia in the Middle Ages, a Gothic building of enormous historical value and great beauty.</p>
<p>The Grand Royal Palace embraces a delightful inner <strong>courtyard surrounded by archways</strong> and full of orange trees, the <em>verger</em>, or orchard. It is open to the public and during the months of good weather it is a peaceful meeting point, undisturbed by the noise and bustle outside. In the middle of the courtyard is a fountain where, during Corpus Christi, an egg dances in the L&#8217;ou com balla celebration.</p>
<h3>The Marès universe</h3>
<p>It is definitely worth going in and taking time to discover the secrets of the Museu Frederic Marès, because it is <strong>packed with items</strong> of every kind. Visitors can admire magnificent wooden Romanesque polychrome sculptures, but there are fans, old pharmacist&#8217;s jars, pipes, toys and lots more too. Such was the universe of Frederic Marès, the sculptor who devoted a large part of his life bringing together Hispanic sculptures and objects in a collection of great value.</p>
<p>The most notable works of art include a <strong>portrait of the Roman emperor Augustus</strong>, from imperial Tàrraco (Tarragona), and an extensive series of <strong>polychrome religious </strong>figures dating from the 12th to the 18th centuries.</p>
<p>Among the <strong>everyday objects</strong>, arranged in ten themed rooms, the collection of women&#8217;s items (clothing, accessories, jewellery, etc.) stands out, as does the photography room and the collection of wrought iron, ranging from medieval keys to strong boxes. Frederic Marès never lost his <strong>passion for collecting</strong>, so the museum continued to expand and be enriched by new items. The lack of space meant work had to be carried out to enlarge it in the 1960s and again at the end of the 20th century. While this work was taking place, a part of the <strong>Roman wall</strong> was discovered, including one of the towers.</p>

<h3>The basilica dedicated to the city&#8217;s patron saint</h3>
<p><strong>Mare de Déu de la Mercè, </strong>Our Lady of Mercy, was proclaimed a patron saint of the city in 1687. Her image, a fourteenth-century Gothic carving, rests on a silver throne on the upper floor, which is open to visits from the public. The <strong>curved Baroque façade </strong>is the only example of this style in the city. On the side of the temple facing <strong>C/ Ample</strong>, is the <strong>flamboyant ancient Gothic façade </strong>of the Church of Sant Miquel, which was torn down around 1870. In fact, <strong>C/ Carabassa</strong>, one of the most beautiful in the area, offers a privileged view of this side of the basilica: its gothic flank and dome, crowned by an <strong>enormous figure of Mary</strong>.</p>
<h3>The former Convent de la Mercè</h3>
<p>The right-hand façade of the basilica is joined by a pretty bridge that crosses C/ la Mercè to the former<strong> Convent de la Mercè</strong>, now the <strong>Capitania General </strong>Ministry of Defence building. The church&#8217;s interior is typically Baroque, with a single nave and side chapels.</p>

<p>The Ateneu Barcelonès promotes and plays host to a variety of cultural events, including chess clubs, theatre, music, exhibitions, conferences and film screenings. For a few years one of the highlights has been the writing school that offers a variety of courses ranging from classes in narrative, poetry and drama to training in journalistic writing, literature and film scripts.</p>
<h3>A Neoclassical gem</h3>
<p>Designed as a stately home, the building was built in 1796 by the Baron Savassona, who was inspired by Gothic Catalan mansions. Highlights include the entrance (made for carriage access), the noble staircase and the library. It was revamped in 1906 and its interior spaces updated almost a century later. The revamping was finished in 2007, with the restoration of the library. The building was declared a <strong>Cultural Asset of National Interest</strong> in 1981.</p>

<p>Plaça del Pi is well known for its church and the pine tree standing in its centre. The façade of the basilica, with its simple lines, houses an enormous rose window, the biggest one in Catalonia. The bell tower is 54 metres high and decorated with Gothic arches. The interior of the church is austere, with a central nave flanked by side chapels, one of which is owned by the city&#8217;s retailers&#8217; guild, which has a building in Plaça del Pi, just in front of the church, on the corner with C/ Petritxol. It is home to the oldest sgraffito in the city, dating from the seventeenth century. In the square is another house worth stopping to look at: the <strong>14th century Congregació de la Puríssima Sang </strong>building. Notable features include a Renaissance door and a row of pillared arches on the top floor.</p>
<h3>A bohemian square</h3>
<p>The area around the Plaça del Pi is frequented by <strong>bohemian artists</strong>, particularly painters, who display their paintings in the square off to the side, Plaça Sant Josep Oriol. Plaça del Pi is also well known for the <strong>Food Crafts People Collective</strong> Fair, offering stalls packed with delicious products every first and third Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the month.</p>

<p>The <strong>Reial Acadèmia de Medicina de Catalunya</strong>&#8216;s headquarters have been housed in the old <strong>Col·legi de Cirurgia</strong> building since 1929, one of the <strong>most important examples of neoclassical architecture in Barcelona</strong> which preserves a spectacular <strong>anatomy amphitheatre</strong> <strong>from the 17th century</strong>. The building was designed by the architect Ventura Rodríguez and constructed between 1762 and 1763. It was where the army&#8217;s surgeons were trained, though it also attended to the civilian population.</p>
<h3>Dissection Table</h3>
<p>The large anatomy amphitheatre is circular and covered by a <strong>spherical dome</strong>. Its elaborate <strong>stained glass</strong> and <strong>Baroque-style ornamental details</strong> make the hall exceptionally beautiful. And its <strong>stone tiers</strong> allowed students to follow practical anatomy dissection classes and occasional operations there. What grabs your full attention, though is its central feature: a <strong>marble dissection table</strong>, one of the few still preserved in Europe. The table is surrounded by two <strong>circular rows of carved wooden chairs </strong>gilded in the <strong>rococo style</strong>, for anyone who wished to follow the practical classes close up to avoid missing any detail.</p>
<p>Important lecturers such as <strong>Pere Virgili</strong>, <strong>Antoni de Gimbernat</strong> and <strong>Santiago Ramon y Cajal</strong> taught in these buildings.</p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s history is closely tied to the sea, so it had to have a museum to explain all about that link. The site chosen was the old royal shipyards, the Reials Drassanes, which bear witness to the city&#8217;s <strong>seafaring past</strong>. Galleys and part of the fleet of the <strong>old</strong> <strong>Crown of Aragon</strong> were built there, warships were repaired and it was a store for equipment, tools and supplies. A whole history and lots of uses linked to the sea that it now bears witness to.</p>
<h3>A historic building</h3>
<p>The Drassanes were built backing onto the city&#8217;s <strong>second medieval walls</strong>, like a huge military fortification, and the yards still preserve the remains of the bastions in <strong>Plaça de Santa Madrona</strong>, as well as one of the entrance gates and part of the old walls.</p>
<p>The most curious thing about them is that for more than two centuries after they lost their original use, they were turned into a military foundry making cannons for the army, a barracks, an arsenal and an artillery store. Just before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, in 1936, the army handed them over to the city, which immediately turned them into the Maritime Museum. And since the 1970s, Barcelona&#8217;s Royal Shipyards have been a <strong>Historical Artistic Heritage Site </strong>.</p>
<p>Today the <strong>splendid halls</strong> devoid of columns, with their high ceilings and gigantic arches, once used to build warships, promote the city&#8217;s <strong>maritime culture</strong> in a museum through which pirates, Vikings, the remains of the <em>Titanic</em> and big scientific discoveries have all passed in exhibitions where the sea has always been the common thread. The <strong>Museu Marítim de Barcelona</strong> (MMB) is open to everyone, adults and children, linking the city even more closely to the sea It is a place to enjoy the maritime world, visual and interactive, and part of the <strong>Raval Cultural</strong> project, which aims to make the neighbourhood&#8217;s artistic and cultural heritage available to everyone.</p>

The American collections came from work carried out in Peru, Bolivia and Central America. And later it incorporated African collections too.</p>
<h3>The birth of the museum</h3>
<p>The MEB&#8217;s origins date back to the 1920s, when a group of intellectuals sought to create information centres on traditional societies. The Ethnological and Colonial Museum opened in 1949 but the MEB&#8217;s current home was officially opened in 1973.</p>

<p>Trinitat no longer collects her herbs from the mountainside; they are professionally cultivated instead. But she <strong>continues to work with them in the traditional way</strong>, using all the knowledge of the master craftsmen. The shop still contains the antique tools with which she grinds and mixes and she continues to advise clients seeking natural remedies to cure their minor ailments. A visit to the local is not only a <strong>joy for the nose</strong>;you should stop and carefully observe the store&#8217;s details, with its nineteenth century decor including a marble fountain where, years before,leeches were kept.</p>

The construction is distributed between four buildings and brings to mind the unmistakable shape of a huge ship. Its facilities include offices for rent, rooms for conventions and commerce and all manner of services, ranging from financial organisations to restaurants, a pharmacy and an up-market hotel.

<h3>Data to be optimistic about</h3>
<p>The WTCB&#8217;s good health can be seen from its figures: in 2014 alone it held more than three hundred <strong>corporate events </strong>attended by a total of 38,000 people. Key events included international conferences, scientific meetings, presentations of new products and businesses and large company dinners. One example of the successful companies with headquarters there is the  travel agency eDreams, which having begun its adventure in the WTCB in 2001 with just eight workers, is now a leading company in Europe.</p>

<p>In the context of providing support for creation and culture, the Nau Ivanow aims to become a big centre for creators and cultural initiatives to exchange ideas. Because offering the ideal place and the necessary means for developing and managing cultural projects as well as small cultural companies is a great way to support cultural creation and enterprise.</p>
<p>The Nau Ivanow offers creators the chance to have a <strong>production space </strong>in a unique setting and a hive of creativity, supporting <strong>cultural projects </strong>in their early days.</p>
<p>The Creators&#8217; Nursery is a work space, where companies, producers and others involved in the performing arts work alongside each other and, at the same time, have the chance to share things and develop their projects, while creating synergies, developing an understanding and cooperating.</p>
<h3>Old buildings, new uses</h3>
<p>In 1959, the businessman Víctor Ivanow commissioned the architect Jordi Figueres with building the <strong>Ivanow paint factory</strong> on a plot of industrialised <strong>Sagrera</strong> land. The building entered into service in 1968 and later changed hands several times until it was acquired by Xavier Basiana. Nau Ivanow has been managed by the Fundació Sagrera since 2006, and has formed part of the <strong>Art Factories </strong>project, promoted by Barcelona City Council’s Institute of Culture, since 2010.</p>

<p>Casa Batlló, pure <strong>Modernista fantasy</strong>, is the work of the architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong>, a symbol of a period and a very specific social class: Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie at the start of the 20th century. It was a time when, thanks to the implementation of the <strong>Cerdà Plan</strong> that had started at the end of the 19th century, many well-off families moved to <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> and also established their businesses there. One businessman who did just that was <strong>Josep Batlló i Casanovas</strong>, who, in 1903, acquired the original building on the site and a year later, in 1904, hired Antoni Gaudí, already very famous, to remodel it.</p>
<h3>A life of its own</h3>
<p>What the architect did was a turning point in modern architecture and left an <strong>artistic legacy</strong> for posterity. By applying his <strong>naturalistic ideas</strong>, with undulating and organic shapes, and creating a new facade totally clad in <strong>stone and glass</strong>, and inspired by coral, he gave the building a completely new and original appearance.</p>
<p>At the same time, Gaudí&#8217;s main aim was always functionality, so it is worth noting the attention he paid to the lighting and the ventilation. He introduced a <strong>large interior courtyard</strong> that the service rooms looked out onto, while the salons and bedrooms were on the side of the facade.</p>
<p>Even today Casa Batlló is seen as an original and daring work, something that gives it incalculable value and led to it being declared a <strong>World Heritage site by UNESCO</strong>.</p>

<p>An <strong>anthology</strong> <i>in its own right</i>, the <strong>Cafè de l’Òpera</strong> has almost two centuries of history behind it. It dates back to the 18th century, before it became known as a café, when it was run as an inn and starting point for coaches setting off for cities such as Zaragoza and Madrid.</p>
<p>Later, in the mid 19th century, this establishment on the Rambla became a famous hot-chocolate shop, often frequented by locals attending shows at the Liceu opera house. Dating from that time, there is still a <strong>collection of mirrors </strong>and some remains of the <strong>Viennese decoration </strong>that was all the rage.</p>
<p>But it was not until <strong>1929</strong> that it was officially opened as the Cafè de l’Òpera and remodelled in the Modernista style that it still preserves today. Restored by the architect Antoni de Moragas, the café remains <strong>one of the most elegant places in Barcelona</strong>.</p>
<h3>A place for everyone</h3>
<p>With an <strong>incredibly diverse atmosphere</strong>, the Cafè de l’Òpera has been the meeting point for both Barcelona and foreign society throughout its lifetime. King Alfonso XIII, anarchists, bohemians, the bourgeoisie and writers have all dropped by this establishment where you can still pop in and enjoy <strong>one of the best collections of whisky in the city</strong> or sip a coffee as you contemplate history through a <strong>window to the past</strong>.</p>

<p>Located on <strong>Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes</strong>, the impressive <strong>Teatre Coliseum</strong> building has hosted some of the most outstanding, daring hit <strong>theatre shows</strong> of the day since <strong>2006</strong>. However, the history of this site goes back to a much earlier time, when, in 1923, the architect <strong>Francesc de Paula Nebot</strong> built the theatre to house a <strong>cinema</strong> for Josep Solà i Guardiola, Victorià Saludes and the Marquis of Argentera.</p>
<p>Inspired by the <strong>Paris Opera</strong>, the building adopts a style similar to that made popular by the <strong>French <em>beaux-arts</em></strong> movement, with a <strong>monumental facade and</strong> <strong>two neo-baroque columns</strong>. The whole is crowned by a great dome. Designed by Valeri Corberó, this feature has been used by various cultural organisations over the years.</p>
<h3>A unique theatre venue</h3>
<p>All kinds of films have been shown on the <strong>Coliseum&#8217;s screen, </strong>and the theatre has always hosted a <strong>varied programme of entertainment </strong>featuring different artistic disciplines, including dance, opera, and classical and popular music. Managed by <strong>Grup Balaña</strong> since 1958, this has become an essential venue at which to <strong>enjoy the best on the Barcelona performing arts scene</strong>.</p>

<p>The Parc d’Atraccions del Tibidabo is one of the oldest amusement parks in Europe still going. When it opened in 1901, it marked the conquest of the mountain by the people of the city and it became a city <strong>leisure icon</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, <strong>Dr Andreu</strong> decided to develop and make the most of the land on Tibidabo, including the summit, where he built an amusement park as the high point of his city-garden project. Initially people walked up to “keep healthy” but the arrival of the <strong>Tramvia Blau</strong> and the <strong>funicular</strong> &#8211; a strange lift, as people described it at the beginning of the 20th century &#8211; meant the amusement park became one of the main leisure haunts of Barcelona folk.</p>
<h3>Hundred-year-old rides and attractions</h3>
<p>The first <strong>crazy mirrors</strong>, which attracted crowds of visitors; <strong>the Talaia</strong>, a watchtower offering unique views over the city from more than 50 metres above the peak; the plane that has been flying round since 1928; the <strong>museu dels autòmats</strong>, with one of the best collections of fairground machines in the world, and the other amusements keep children and adults happy and from part of the city&#8217;s collective memory.</p>
<p>It is an iconic place that even stole the heart of <strong>Walt Disney</strong> himself. Legend has it that he wrote a blank cheque for one of Tibidabo&#8217;s fairground machines but he never got it. Perhaps Tibidabo worked its magic.</p>

<h3>A testament to hard times</h3>
<p>It was during the Universal Exposition of 1888 that this establishment saw the explosion in the hotel business.From its time as a friary it has preserved some unusual remains, such as the <strong>underground tunnel </strong>that links the friars rooms with the Church of Sant Agustí and that the monks used in turbulent periods. The bedrooms have retained the simplicity of the <strong>former religious chambers</strong>, with low ceilings, wooden beams, tile floors and simple furniture.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s Casa Figueras keeps a good part of the look it had been given by the theatrical designer <strong>Ros i Güell</strong> following its remodelling in 1902. Ros was surrounded by <strong>Modernista craftsmen</strong> and designed a complete renovation including stained glass windows, ironwork, paintings and sculptural ornaments, notable among which is the mosaic work by the Italian artist Maragliano.</p>

<p>The Editorial Gustavo Gili head office reflects the main ideas of <strong>Rationalist architecture</strong>: the use of new materials, elimination of superfluous decoration, submission of form to function, consistency with the surroundings and making use of natural light. The architects had been trained in the theories of GATCPAC, a group of progressive Catalan architects, and they were enthusiastic supporters of the new architecture as opposed to out-of-date classicism.</p>

The training it started with, especially in the field of <strong>automobiles</strong> and <strong>electronics</strong>, is still very much part of the school, though it has been supplemented by training in other sectors such as tourism, marketing and renewable energies, as well as compulsory secondary education (ESO). Its aim now is to continue its teaching work, which has enabled thousands of students to develop their professional careers.</p>

<p>A visit to Club Esportiu Europa at the weekend means experiencing the <strong>very essence of football</strong>: parents going to see their children, local teams, tickets at budget prices and an exciting atmosphere. The ground, known as the Nou Sardenya, was revamped in 1995. Now it  is 100 m by 63 m in area and has a seating capacity for 7,000 spectators, 1,000 of them in the covered grandstand.</p>
<h3>The know-how of a club with character</h3>
<p>Club Esportiu Europa is proud of its history. It was one of the ten <strong>founding teams</strong> of the Spanish Football League, in the First Division, where it competed in the first three seasons, though it was in the Second Division for five seasons in the 1960s. They have also won the <strong>Catalonia Cup </strong>three times: in 1997, 1998 and 2015.</p>
<p>The women&#8217;s section was set up in 2001 and the first team plays in the Second Division of the Spanish Women&#8217;s Football League.</p>

<p>Las Golondrinas is actually the name of the company that bought the first steam boats and acquired a licence to make harbour crossings during the Universal Exposition <strong>in 1888</strong>. Following that, throughout the 20th century a boat trip on board a <em>golondrina</em> became one of the main attractions for children and adults, and was only interrupted by the Civil War.</p>
<p>The catamarans that leave from the Columbus statue these days offer a trip that lasts more than an hour and goes as far as the Forum in Sant Adrià de Besòs. They have a lower deck with windows below the sea&#8217;s surface that offer passengers underwater views. But there are also three, twin-decked, <strong>traditional <em>golondrinas</em></strong> still in service that date from the 1940s and are made of wood.</p>
<p>There has only been one serious accident in the history of this popular pastime. That was in 1922, when a ship collided with a <em>golondrina</em> causing many injuries and 10 fatalities.</p>
<h3 class=\"title\">Barcelona from the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Both the traditional <em>golondrinas</em> and the catamarans offer passengers an unusual view of Barcelona: from the sea. On board these boats it is easy to imagine pirates closing in on the city or the many naval battles that have taken place off the coast here.</p>
<p>Today, though, the tranquil trip lets you enjoy the maritime skyline with the Columbus Monument, Hotel W, Agbar Tower, Maremàgnum shopping complex, Montjuïc, Hotel Arts and Mapfre Tower, among other buildings.</p>

<p>The original industrial character of the building has been preserved and it can be visited at weekends.</p>
<h3>A pioneering system in Europe</h3>
<p>The IED was founded in Milan in 1966 by Francesco Morelli, who envisaged an <strong>international school </strong>that would show designers how to be competitive on a global scale. Nearly 50 years later, IED Barcelona is a multinational centre that attracts approximately 700 foreign students every year.</p>
<p>The Institute encourages students to seek inspiration from the visual reality that surrounds them and to learn how to identify new trends, shifts and innovation wherever they go, without losing sight of local and global market needs. In this context, IED Barcelona participates in events such as <strong>48H Open House BCN, 080 Barcelona Fashion </strong>and <strong>The Brandery.</strong></p>

<p>Situated on Avinguda de Pedralbes are the estate pavilions that Count Eusebi Güell commissioned architect <strong>Antoni Gaudí</strong> to build in the late 19th century. Famous for their colourfulness and forms, which are faithful to Gaudí&#8217;s most curious architectural style, these pavilions are full of <strong>mythological and aesthetic details </strong>that make them one of the architectural gems of Barcelona. This was the <strong>first project </strong>that Eusebi Güell commissioned Gaudí to undertake and it marked the start of a lengthy collaboration that resulted in many great works in the city. Between 1884 and 1887, Gaudí redesigned the garden and built the <strong>two pavilions </strong>at the entrance that we know today. With a stone base, these gatehouses feature walls the are heavily adorned with <strong>brick and ceramic </strong>elements. The project, with <strong>oriental airs</strong>, is even reminiscent of Mudejar art in some parts. The star feature of the construction are the entrance gate railings, featuring an <strong>iron dragon </strong>with glass eyes, in honour of the mythological dragon guarding the Garden of the Hesperides. The gate led into the Jardins de les Hespèrides, following the <strong>re-creation of the poem <em>L’Atlàntida</em></strong>, by Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer, and together with the Font d’Hèrcules (Hercules Fountain) in the Pedralbes gardens, forms part of the same tale.</p>
<h3>Inside</h3>
<p>In 1969, the pavilions were declared a <strong>National Historical and Artistic Monument </strong>and, until 2008, they served as the seat of the Royal Gaudi Chair, belonging to the Polytechnic University of Barcelona. Currently they are open to the public at the weekends and are well worth a visit although, if you only get the chance to go there on a week day, it is still worth going along just to see them from the outside, guarded by their foreboding dragon.</p>

<p>From 1985 to 1987, between Carrer del Bac de Roda and Carrer de Felip II, in an area devoid of large buildings at the time, the Valencian architect <strong>Santiago Calatrava</strong> erected a spectacular bridge that won the <strong>FAD Prize for Architecture</strong> and earned him international fame.</p>
<p>The two <strong>twin arches of white steel</strong> and the four supporting cables that form this emblematic <strong>bridge</strong>, as well as the lights integrated into the railing and the roadway, meant this piece of civil engineering became a sculptural treasure. Today the Pont de Calatrava is an icon of the <strong> new architecture</strong> that began to appear after Barcelona was chosen to host the <strong>1992 Olympics</strong> and has never stopped since, filling the city with ever more daring buildings and constructions.</p>
<h3>A conceptual work</h3>
<p>The bridge, which links the <strong>Sant Andreu and Sant Martí</strong> districts, can be crossed by vehicles and pedestrians. And crossing it gives you the chance to enjoy all its expressiveness, as its lines represent human forms, as well as visually demonstrating the <strong>tension of opposing forces</strong> which, when they are controlled, can produce engineering works like this one.</p>

Behind La Escocesa is the <strong>Associació d’Idees Ema </strong>(“M Ideas Association”), which has run the centre since 2008. Its aim is to <strong>encourage artistic creation </strong>by supporting resident artists, who have the option of renting spaces, equipment and material, as well as applying for grants and making contact with other centres, amongst other benefits.</p>
<p>La Escocesa also aims to <strong>raise awareness</strong> about art among citizens, particularly local people in the district. The centre participates in exchange programmes to publicise its artists’ and groups’ projects internationally, and the <strong>Espai M</strong> (“M Space”) exhibits work by artists in residence, as well as hosting other shows and activities.</p>
<h3>The history of a factory</h3>
<p>The first building in La Escocesa industrial complex dates back to around 1885, when the site operated as a <strong>textile factory</strong>. The industrial site was occupied by various companies, which rented space here. One such, La Escocesa, finally gave its name to the whole complex. La Escocesa took over most of the buildings for a century, eventually closing down in 1984.</p>

<p>The 40,000 square metres that make up this space encompass all the stages of music: performance in the <strong>Auditori </strong>concert halls, training in the <strong>Escola Superior de Música de Catalunya</strong> and history in the <strong>Museu de la Música</strong>. The ESMUC offers degree, postgraduate and Master&#8217;s courses in a <strong>cross-the-board education programme </strong>that includes every musical discipline: <strong>composing, conducting and performing</strong> classical and contemporary music, jazz and modern music and early and traditional music. This is complemented by other courses in <strong>musicology, pedagogy, sonology, production and management.</strong></p>
<h3>Rafael Moneo&#8217;s spectacular building</h3>
<p>The building designed by Moneo is a spectacular <strong>compact concrete block</strong> covered with <strong>rusted steel panels</strong> that takes up two blocks of the Eixample. Its central body, resting on columns, forms a passage that lets you cross the building. There is a spectacular, <strong>monumental glass cube</strong> here, decorated by the sculptor Pablo Palazuelo, which acts as the building&#8217;s atrium.</p>

In its interior, pictures attributed to Opisso show scenes of leisure and games from the period.

<p><strong>Casa Serra</strong>, which stands at the heart of the Eixample, was declared a <strong>Cultural Asset of National Interest </strong>in 2001. It is a Modernista building with <strong>Plateresque features</strong> designed by the architect Puig i Cadafalch between 1904 and 1908.</p>
<h3>A building of tributes</h3>
<p>The medievalistic features were introduced with the idea of reproducing the main door and window decoration of an <strong>old house </strong>on Carrer de la Portaferrissa, <strong>Casa Gralla</strong>, which was demolished in the 19th century. The two men commissioned for the sculptural part of the facade were Puig i Cadafalch&#8217;s trusted collaborators, <strong>Eusebi Arnau and Alfons Juyol</strong>, who placed <strong>busts of famous figures, such as the painter Marià Fortuny</strong>, on each window.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Over the years, Casa Serra has had lots of owner and uses. It housed a nun&#8217;s college in 1908 and during the Civil War it was the headquarters of the Ministry of Health. Then, in the 1980s, it was refurbished to accommodate the offices of <strong>Barcelona Provincial Council.</strong></p>

<h3>A shop that&#8217;s finger-licking good</h3>
<p>Few can resist the temptations on offer in the museum&#8217;s shop: where you will find <strong>chocolate galore</strong> on sale in delicious and original creations. There are bars with <strong>fruit</strong>, with varying quantities of <strong>cacao</strong>, with <strong>olive oil</strong>, <strong><i>crema catalana</i></strong> and, even the traditional <strong><i>mel i mató</i></strong> [Catalan cottage cheese and honey]. Choosing is the hardest part. The Chocolate Museum is part of the Raval Cultural project, a collection of over three hundred cultural offerings from the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In Barcelona the <strong>industrial revolution </strong>was particularly important throughout the 19th century<strong>, </strong>and was based around the textile industry. As it was a walled city, the new factories set up in the nearby towns, like Sants. The Vapor Vell factory opened in this <strong>former independent municipality,</strong> which today is part of the city. With its innovative use of steam, it was considered to be one of Catalonia&#8217;s <strong>great modern factories</strong>.</p>
<p>The construction of the building, owned by Güell, Ramis i Companyia, began in 1844, and two years later it began producing velvet. It became one of the most important factories in the sector, as it provided employment for <strong>thousands of workers</strong>, but the 1889 cotton crisis led to its closure. The following year <strong>Eusebi Güell</strong>, the son of the founder, moved the business to Colònia Güell, an industrial village in Santa Coloma de Cervelló.</p>
<h3>Culture in motion</h3>
<p>Since then, the building has been used for many different things. One of the most unusual came just after its closure as a factory, when the pioneering filmmaker <strong>Fructuós Gelabert</strong> chose the courtyard for shooting the main scene in <em>Riña en un café</em>, considered to be Spain&#8217;s <strong>first feature film</strong>.</p>
<p>It subsequently passed through many hands, from the CNT (the anarchist trade union) in the Civil War to the Rumasa company in the 1970s, until finally, in the middle of the 1980s, it was acquired by the City Council, who decided to convert this industrial complex into a <strong>local library</strong>, which was officially <strong>inaugurated in 2000</strong>.</p>
<p>Considered to be a <strong>historical monument </strong>and piece of cultural heritage, the building which today houses the <strong>modern Biblioteca</strong> <strong>Vapor Vell</strong> continues to be a driving force in the neighbourhood, encouraging and <strong>developing culture </strong>in Sants. You can participate in discussions, book clubs, conferences, workshops and a whole host of other activities that take place every day in this place full of <strong>history and memories</strong>.</p>

<p>The site the factory had occupied became City Council property when the company moved to Santa Perpètua.

There is a large, semicircular lake at the centre, known as the <strong>Estany de Narcís Monturiol</strong>. A boat-shaped iron building has been preserved at one end. This is the work of Juan Fernando de Mendoza and houses the <strong>Museu Macosa MTM</strong>, a museum which keeps historical company documents and other items. It is currently closed.</p>
<h3>La Maquinista drive wheel</h3>
<p>One of the park&#8217;s most characteristic elements must be the <strong>drive wheel</strong> of the first steam engine that the factory used when it was located in La Barceloneta, and which was moved to Sant Andreu in 1963. It also stands out for the originality of the lamps in its park, which mimic the shape of factory chimneys.</p>

<p>Barcelona&#8217;s bourgeoisie at the close of the 19th century liked to have opulent buildings built for them on Passeig de Gràcia, to show off their power. The Casas-Carbó were no exception: the stone facade, with detailed sculpture work, the bay windows on the main floor and the elegance of the whole building were an unequivocal <strong>declaration of intent</strong>.</p>
<h3>Treasures hidden inside</h3>
<p>The main floor preserves part of the original decoration, with wrought-iron and ceramic features, and a magnificent sculpted fireplace, created by the decorator Josep Pascó. This floor leads to the terrace, with the chance to enjoy one of the most spectacular <strong>interior courtyards </strong>in the Eixample: from here you can admire the rear facade of the Pedrera, which is in the same block of houses. For years the building has housed <strong>Vinçon</strong>, a shop selling designer furniture and household goods.</p>

<p>Standing between two party walls, <strong>Casa Santurce</strong> was commissioned by the Count of Santurtzi (Santurce) <strong>Pablo Ibarri</strong>.

<h3>Modernista style</h3>
<p>Listed as an <strong>Asset of Local Interest</strong>, Casa Santurce has a <strong>symmetrical facade</strong> with five openings per floor. Each flat has its own balcony made of stone with an iron balustrade.</p>
<p>The building&#8217;s outstanding features are the <strong>bay windows</strong> at either end of the facade. These are a <strong>very Modernista detail</strong>, made with wrought iron and polychrome stained glass, and crowned with little towers covered in black ceramic. Even today you can still see a coat of arms with the owner&#8217;s name at the entrance.</p>

<p>A very elegant family residence, Casa Queraltó is easily distinguished from the other buildings by its <strong>original pink sgraffito work</strong>, which brightens up the whole facade. It was designed by the architect <strong>Josep Plantada Artigas </strong>between 1906 and 1907 with a clear Modernista influence.</p>
<h3>Quality architecture</h3>
<p>Huge in size and <strong>chamfered in structure</strong>, Casa Queraltó takes up the whole of the corner between Rambla de Catalunya and Carrer de Mallorca. It used to be crowned by some <strong>pinnacles and a little temple that have now gone. </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Casa Queraltó still has several <strong>attractive, semicircular bay windows on one side, </strong>highly decorated with arches and columns, which make it a building of <strong>great architectural beauty</strong>. And it was in this house that the future American ambassador, Teodoro Moscoso, was born in 1910. As a politician he also drove Puerto Rico&#8217;s economic development between 1950 and 1970.</p>

<p>The spectacular <strong>wooden marquetry of the bay windows</strong> that make up the main facade of Casa Dolors Calm is the outstanding feature of this <strong>Modernista building</strong>. The actual facades, either side of the enormous bay windows and lacking any volume, almost pass you by, given the force of the central part. They are covered in <strong>scarlet red and sky blue sgraffito</strong>, with a small balcony and wrought iron balustrade on each floor.</p>
<h3>Historical establishments</h3>
<p>Refurbished in 2010, the historical <strong>Ferreteria Villà</strong> ironmonger&#8217;s is still going strong, on the ground floor. It also housed the <strong>Joan Prats art gallery</strong> until 2014, which had to move when the rent proved unaffordable.</p>

<p>The Sarret bakery still has <strong>many original period details</strong>, such as the <strong>revolving stone oven</strong>, where its craft bread is still baked today, and the <strong>wooden drawers</strong> the dough ferments in. The entrance and shop windows still preserve their wood and the <strong>original Modernista glass</strong>, but there have been some changes. For example, the leaded glass sign has gone, replaced by a printed one. There is a <strong>large, ceramic medallion</strong> in the middle, between the two entrance doors, with the image of a woman gathering wheat. You can still see a painting with the bakery&#8217;s name inside in Modernista letters. The bakery is on the ground floor of an <strong>1866 building</strong> by Felip Ubach who, among other things, also designed the old Ricart factory in Raval.</p>
<h3>A 100-year-old bakery</h3>
<p>The Sarret bakery has never stopped making and selling bread in over a century, although it <strong>has changed hands a few times</strong>. The current owners restored the name of the family who opened it, Sarret, as a tribute to the craft bakers of that time. These days they sell a wide range of bread, cakes and pastries.</p>

Some of these figures are halfway between a plant and an animal: the interpretation is in the eye of the beholder. The <strong>gargoyles</strong> and the <strong>capitals</strong> with the heads of women and satyrs, surrounded by flowers, also stand out. And the interior is just as extraordinary as the exterior, with glazed ceramic tiles, stucco and sgraffito decoration. Quite a sight!</p>
<h3>Montjuïc stone</h3>
<p>The whole facade is made with stone brought from Montjuïc, a precious material that <strong>changes colour</strong>, depending on the light shining on it. And, besides the practically hallucinatory decoration, there are the <strong>curved and triangular</strong> <strong>bay windows</strong> that are very typical of this architect.</p>

<p>These houses, built of stone and richly ornamented, were commissioned by the powerful Rocamora family and follow the <strong>neo-Gothic trend</strong> that was so popular in the first third of the 20th century. Their outstanding features are the imposing <strong>bay windows </strong>of the five floors, the <strong>sculptural decoration in stone </strong>and the massive, <strong>semicircular tower</strong> on the corner, topped with a cone-shaped dome that gives the whole complex the air of a medieval fortress. A touch of colour is added by the five domes. These are covered by <strong>orange-coloured ceramic tiles</strong>, which shine and change shade depending on the light.</p>
<h3>Showing off their power</h3>
<p>It was very common from the end of the 19th century until well into the 20th for the Catalan bourgeoisie to have <strong>opulent houses</strong> built to could show off their wealth. This was done by the Barcelona families that had grown rich from industrialisation and chosen <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong> as their new place of residence.</p>

<p>Located on <strong>Passeig de Gràcia</strong>, in the family property where the collector grew up, this non-profit foundation offers a <strong>full panorama of art in the 20th century</strong>, especially by Spanish and Italian artists. It is a large, open space where the works are shown in chronological order.</p>
<h3>Valuing the present</h3>
<p>Besides the permanent collection, the Suñol Foundation displays <strong>travelling works by new artists</strong> in a part called <i>Nivell Zero</i> (<i>Level Zero</i>).A wide range of events are held there, including talks, exhibitions, film screenings, concerts and poetry readings. This busy cultural agenda has turned the foundation into a major <strong>driving force of art in Barcelona.   </strong></p>

There is also a <strong>microbrewery</strong> where they brew fresh, unpasteurised Moritz, which customers can taste on the premises. Moritz Epidor (the strongest) is also served, along with the classic Moritz and non-alcoholic Moritz.</p>

<p>The location of Casa Llopis Bofill on a chamfered corner forced the architect to distribute the usual elements of the facade in a very unorthodox manner. In the middle, a vertical band with bay windows splits the facade into two symmetrical parts and, on the sides, a column of bay windows adds the finishing touch to the two vertexes. As for materials, Gallissà preferred <strong>brick </strong>and <strong>stucco </strong>to the traditional stone, and he combined those with iron, ceramic tiles and glass. The current appearance of the house is very like the original, despite the work carried out to repair the damage caused during the Civil War.</p>
<h3>In search of a national architecture</h3>
<p>Like many other architects and intellectuals of the time, Gallissà believed it was necessary to find a <strong>national style</strong> that would convey the spirit of Catalonia, along the lines Lluís Domènech i Montaner had posed in his famous essay <i>En busca de una arquitectura nacional (In Search of a National Architecture).</i></p>

<p>When it came to decoration, the future architect of the Palau de la Música Catalana turned to his regular team of collaborators including, among others, the sculptor <strong>Eusebi Arnau</strong> and the glazier <strong>Antoni Rigalt</strong>.</p>
<h3>Modernista opulence</h3>
<p>Palau Montaner now houses the Central Government Delegation in Barcelona, and is open to the public on certain days of the year. The stained-glass windows, plant motifs, marble mosaics, noble staircase, medieval-inspired sculptures and ceiling decoration all make this a real showcase for <strong>Modernista luxury</strong>.</p>

<p >The architect <strong>Antoni Rovira i Trias</strong>, also responsible for Sant Antoni Market, designed a tall open building, taking advantage of the new possibilities offered by the <strong>use of iron</strong> as a structural element. So, Concepció, along with Born and Libertat, was one of many <strong>municipal markets</strong> built in the final third of the 19th century that were inspired by buildings such as Crystal Palace in London and Les Halles in Paris. The use of <strong>metal frames</strong> rather than the traditional stone was one of the biggest changes in Catalan public architecture at the close of the century.</p>
<h3>The building</h3>
<p>The market is rectangular. It is 38 metres wide by 105 metres long, and covers an area of 4,010 square metres. It has three aisles or sections: a large central aisle 13 metres high and two, smaller side aisles. The pitched roof is made from <strong>glazed ceramic</strong> tiles and the walls are bare brick. Together these features make this an important example of <strong>public architecture</strong> from the end of the 19th century, combining Modernisme with the new construction systems.</p>

He also placed a gallery along the front of the top storey in line with the balcony running along the main floor.</p>
<p>The architect Cristian Cirici restored the building in 1980, and received the National Restoration Award for that year. The ground floor has been occupied for decades now by the furniture designers <strong>Casa Cubiñá</strong>.</p>

<p>Declared a <strong>Cultural Asset of National Interest</strong> in 1973, Casa Macaya, with its imposing white stucco facade and stone sculpture, catches the eye of pedestrians on <strong>Passeig de Sant Joan</strong>. It was designed by the architect <strong>Josep Puig i Cadafalch</strong>, and its Modernista style, with Civil Gothic influences, is unmistakable even today, 100 years after its was built.</p>
<p>Commissioned by the <strong>industrialist Roman Macaya Gibert</strong>, Casa Macaya stands out for its architectural beauty and the contrast between the apparent simplicity of its white facade and the lavish stone decoration of the windows. The stone sculptures are the work of Puig i Cadafalch&#8217;s regular collaborators,<strong> Eusebi Arnau and Alfons</strong> <strong>Juyol.</strong></p>
<h3>The evolution of a space</h3>
<p>The outstanding features of the interior are the <strong>big stone arches</strong> and the ornamental staircase with floral motifs that used to lead to what was the main house of the Macaya family until 1914. Today the building, which is also known as Palau Macaya, serves as a <strong>social and sustainability centre</strong> of ”la Caixa”, who acquired it in 1947.</p>

<h3>Senses turned into art</h3>
<p>Its collection, which ranges from thousand-year-old <strong>Greek, Egyptian and Arabian containers</strong> to the latest productions, shows how perfume has always been very closely linked to human sensitivity. The elegant materials used to make them, such as china and crystal, can be seen in the <strong>bottles from the 16th and 19th centuries </strong>, notably two that belonged to Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>The exhibition also focuses on perfume as a commercial product. It includes <strong>more than 10,000 containers</strong>, among which the <i>Roi Soleil</i> (Sun King), bottle designed by <strong>the artist Salvador Dalí</strong>, stands out, as do some of iconic brands such as Dior or Guerlain.</p>

<h3> A trip through the world of beer</h3>
<p>You can visit the brewery for free any Wednesday, if you book in advance, and during the <strong>48h Open House Barcelona </strong>weekend too. As you take the tour, accompanied by an ice-cool <strong>Estrella</strong> in your hand, you can see the permanent exhibition and the old <strong>brewing </strong>and engine rooms, as well as enjoy the new upper floor, with a weighing room and pleasant terrace. The building has the <strong>classic industrial design of the period</strong>: the facades, combining stucco and exposed brickwork, and the conical chimney, are typical of early 20th-century factory architecture.</p>

It is decorated in <strong>polychrome ceramic</strong> mosaics by the artist Lluís Bru i Salelles, and covered by wooden galleries that draw uneven lines and give it a strange appearance. On the ground floor, the parabolic arches and organic treatment of the stone once again hark back to Gaudí.</p>

<p>Standing at a point where the old path from <strong>Les Corts to Sarrià </strong>used to run, when this was a completely rural area and the two districts were separate townships from Barcelona, the former <strong>Can Rosés farmhouse</strong> has a long history. Now converted into a library, Can Rosés has a two-fold historical value, as it also houses the <strong>historic and local documentary collection </strong>of Les Corts district and its neighbourhoods.</p>
<h3>A constant purpose</h3>
<p>Built in the <strong>first half of the eighteenth century</strong> and altered in 1900 by Joaquim Gelabert i Cuyás, the farmhouse is listed as <strong>local heritage</strong> in the city. In 1991, the site was refurbished for the second time, on this occasion to convert it into the <strong>municipal library</strong> we see today.</p>
<p>The library contains more than <strong>39,000 reference documents </strong>relating to the history of <strong>Les Corts</strong>,its parks, gardens, farmhouses, <strong>buildings, festivities</strong> and local institutions, such as <strong>FC Barcelona</strong>. These resources take us on a journey through the everyday history of a former township and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>UNED was established by decree in 1972 and opened in 1973. It is a nationwide <strong>public university</strong> that lets people study by <strong>distance learning</strong>. To enable students to have direct contact with their lecturers, it has a <strong>network of centres</strong> round Spain, and the building in Nou Barris is one of the <strong>newest and most innovative</strong>.</p>
<p>Occupying 2,600 square metres ceded by the City Council, the Nou Barris centre has, since 2012, been serving the more than <strong>12,000 students</strong> enrolled at UNED in the province of Barcelona, most of whom live in the city. It has classrooms, laboratories and <strong>innovative facilities</strong>, such as rooms equipped with web conference technology and a library with 20,000 books that has already become a <strong>benchmark centre</strong>.</p>
<h3>The new university neighbourhood</h3>
<p>The opening of the centre has led to a new university campus being set up in <strong>Nou Barris</strong> and this has given the <strong>Porta neighbourhood</strong>, where it is based, an educational and cultural boost. The centre wants to become an <strong>open space</strong> in the area, opening the library to all local residents who can use it throughout the year except at exam time, when it is reserved for students.</p>
<p>On top of that, it has helped to <strong>revive the district</strong> and given a new boost to a little-known part of the city, full of <strong>very appealing places </strong>for young people such as the two shopping centres nearby and the Can Dragó Sports Park.</p>

<p>In 2012, the Catalan government presented the Fundació Blanquerna with the <strong>Creu de Sant Jordi</strong> in recognition of its work in education. Since its beginnings as a centre linked to the Bishopric of Barcelona, it has excelled in the field of <strong>training of teachers and education professionals</strong>. Currently it offers courses on psychology, speech therapy, infant and primary school teaching, translation and physical activity. It offers degrees, postgraduate studies, Masters, PhDs and ongoing training, as well as work experience in leading companies with which it has agreements. The faculty has 250 lecturers and more than 3000 students enrolled.</p>
<p>Its Christian heritage has led it to establish itself as a <strong>non-profit institution</strong>, and the faculty reinvests any profits in teaching, as well as charitable projects</p>
<h3>A pioneering institution</h3>
<p>The Blanquerna Faculty of Psychology, Education and Sports Sciences is housed in a modern building in the heart of <strong>Bonanova</strong>, one of Barcelona&#8217;s most exclusive areas. Just like the La Salle School of Engineering and Architecture, also in Bonanova, and the Institut Químic de Sarrià (IQS &#8211; Institute of Chemistry), the faculty subscribes to the private and religious educational training of this well-off neighbourhood and, like these other institutions, was a founding member of <strong>Ramon Llull University</strong>, in 1991.</p>

An agreement with the Jesuits allowed them to set up the school in 1958, which began by offering<strong> degrees in business science</strong>. The centre kept expanding and in 1964 it opened its first MBA programme. In 1969 it established the first <strong>European Documentation Centre </strong>in Spain. In 2001 it opened its Madrid campus, and in 2003, set up another in Buenos Aires. 2009 saw the inauguration of the ESADE Sant Cugat Creapolis campus. Since 1995, the centre has been part of <strong>Ramon Llull University</strong>.</p>
<h3>The pedralbes campus</h3>
<p>ESADE&#8217;s Barcelona campus, with around <strong>30,000 square metres</strong>, is located in the Pedralbes neighbourhood, very close to the <strong>university zone</strong> on Avinguda de la Diagonal. The school has a further campus in the neighbouring town of Sant Cugat, as well as in Madrid and Buenos Aires. In total there are <strong>13,000 students </strong>at the centres.</p>

<p>The Model prison adopted the system conceived by the English thinker Jeremy Bentham, who proposed a <strong>radial, panoptic layout</strong> with a central tower that meant the whole complex could be controlled from a single point. The architects <strong>Salvador Vinyals and Josep Domènech i Estapà</strong> were commissioned to design it. Under Franco it became a symbol of repression, and many political and trade union activists passed through its cells. Prisoners were executed here until 1974, the last being <strong>Salvador Puig Antich</strong>, who was garrotted and one of the last victims of the dictatorship. The Barcelona director <strong>Manuel Huerga</strong> dedicated his film <i>Salvador</i> to him.</p>
<h3>Over 100 years of history</h3>
<p>The future <strong>demolition</strong> of the Model prison will free up an area equivalent to one and a half residential blocks for neighbourhood use. That means residents in the Nova Esquerra de l’Eixample neighbourhood will gain a sizeable area for green spaces and <strong>municipal facilities</strong>, including a nursery school, a day centre for the elderly and a sports centre.</p>

<p>The Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district has a large number of<br />
renowned <strong>schools and universities</strong>. Most of these are private and linked to religious orders and they include IQS, l’Escola Blanquerna, La Salle (these three are members of Ramon Llull University), Abat Oliba University and the International University of Catalonia. There are also some other high-level academic institutions including the University School of Design and Art, the Felicidad Duce School of Higher Education in Fashion Design and one of the two main sites of the Llotja School, making Sarrià-San Gervasi a vital district in terms of <strong>knowledge</strong> and <strong>training</strong>.</p>

<p>The architects Guillem Giráldez Dávila, Pere López-Iñigo and Xavier Subias Fages opened an architecture office in 1956. Together they began to research into a <strong>contemporary architectural language </strong>all their own, that rejected the academic and monumental styles prevalent in the country at the time. In 1957, the team undertook the project for the Faculty of Law, which the following year won them the first FAD prize for architecture. For the architect Oriol Bohigas<strong>, </strong>it was &#8220;the first modern and civilised public building constructed in Catalonia after the war&#8221;.</p>
<h3>Integrating the arts</h3>
<p>The building exudes the rigour of volumes and structure, including transparency in the façade composition. In addition, it integrates the arts, as exemplified by the mural located on the main door of the faculty: <i>Les taules de la llei</i> (the Tablets of Law) by the sculptor <strong>Josep Maria Subirachs</strong> and the ceramics artist Antoni Cumella. The Faculty of Law features in Barcelona&#8217;s architectural, and historical and artistic heritage catalogue.</p>
